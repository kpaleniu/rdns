# rdns — TODO / Next Steps

Working notes for picking this up cold. "Open work" is what is left; the
"Architecture" sections describe what exists and why it is shaped that way.
Completed work is one line each under "Done so far" — the reasoning, RFC
citations and verification for each piece are in its commit message, which is
where to look rather than here.

---

## Current state (last updated 2026-07-26)

**Workspace** — four members, all on branch `master`:

| crate   | what it is                                                        |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rdns`  | the library: wire codec, zones, cache, resolver, DNSSEC           |
| `rdnsc` | command-line query client                                         |
| `rdnsd` | authoritative server — serves zone files, one process per transport |
| `rdnsr` | recursive resolver with a caching layer; forwards on `--upstream` |

**Green as of the last commit:** `cargo build --workspace` clean,
`cargo test --workspace` = **381 lib + 15 integration** tests passing,
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` **clean, no exceptions**.

**#5 is closed, and TSIG and NOTIFY with it.** The work now has a spine: **#7,
the secondary role** — `rdnsd` can hand a zone out (AXFR) and announce a change
(NOTIFY) but cannot *be* a replica of anything, which is what IXFR would exist to
serve. #7 lists it in six steps with the persistence design settled first (see
"Architecture: persistence"). Start at step 1.

Still open outside that: #2's RFC 5011 key rollover (cheaper than it looks — see
the item), CNAME-chain validation and `rdnsd` zone signing; #1's two
aggressive-use extensions; and #6, a candidate rather than a plan.

**The flaky test is fixed.** `bench::bench_logger_throughput` asserted
`>45k ops/sec` against a measurement of 47–50k, so any competing load failed the
suite; the floor is 10k now, which still catches an order-of-magnitude
regression. The other benches keep their floors — `bench_zone_lookup`'s is a
factor of ten under what it measures, which is the rule to follow when adding
one. A wall-clock assertion with no headroom is a coin toss, not a test.

### How to run

```sh
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets

# Authoritative server. The zone origin comes from the FILENAME:
# example.com.zone serves example.com — a mismatch silently yields NXDOMAIN for
# everything. Serves UDP and TCP; run one process per transport.
cargo run -p rdnsd -- udp --host 127.0.0.1 --port 15353 --zone-file example.com.zone
cargo run -p rdnsd -- tcp --host 127.0.0.1 --port 15353 --zone-file example.com.zone

# Zone transfers are refused unless a peer is named. AXFR is TCP-only.
cargo run -p rdnsd -- tcp --port 15353 --zone-file example.com.zone \
  --allow-transfer 127.0.0.1 --allow-transfer 10.0.0.0/8

# Response bytes per second per client (UDP). 8192 by default; 0 turns it off.
cargo run -p rdnsd -- udp --port 15353 --zone-file example.com.zone --response-rate 4096

# Resolver, recursing from the root hints. Serves UDP and TCP on one port, and
# binds 127.0.0.1 by default on purpose — not an open resolver.
cargo run -p rdnsr -- --port 15354

# Recursing from a custom root hints file (named.root format) instead of the
# built-in v4+v6 list.
cargo run -p rdnsr -- --port 15354 --root-hints ./named.root

# Same resolver, forwarding instead of recursing.
cargo run -p rdnsr -- --port 15354 --upstream 127.0.0.1:15353

# Validating DNSSEC against the built-in ICANN root anchor. Fails closed:
# an answer that does not verify gets SERVFAIL, not the data.
cargo run -p rdnsr -- --port 15354 --dnssec-validate

# ...or against an anchor file, which is what to use when the root KSK rolls.
# DS presentation format; the digest may be split across whitespace.
cargo run -p rdnsr -- --port 15354 --dnssec-validate --trust-anchor ./root-anchors.txt
```

### Verifying, and one trap that invalidates it

**Check first whether the network hijacks port 53.** Send any DNS query to
`192.0.2.1` — TEST-NET-1, reserved for documentation, which cannot host a
server. If something answers, every outbound port-53 query on this machine is
being intercepted and answered by a middlebox:

```sh
python -c "import socket;s=socket.socket(2,2);s.settimeout(3);s.sendto(bytes.fromhex('424201000001000000000000') + b'\x07example\x03com\x00\x00\x01\x00\x01',('192.0.2.1',53));print('INTERCEPTED:',len(s.recv(512)),'bytes')"
```

That is the case on the machine this was developed on, and it has two
consequences worth knowing before trusting any measurement in this repo:

- **Recursion cannot be verified here.** Iterative (RD=0) queries to the real
  root addresses get SERVFAIL from the interceptor, so `rdnsr`'s default mode
  fails while forwarding works — the interceptor answers RD=1 happily.
- **`--upstream 8.8.8.8` means "whatever answers port 53"**, not Google. Every
  figure recorded here that involved a public resolver was really measured
  against the interceptor.

For local verification, `nslookup` is unreliable against a non-53 port on
Windows — it reports "No response from server" even when the server replied.
Probe with a raw `System.Net.Sockets.UdpClient` in PowerShell and read the
bytes; that is how the "verified live" claims here were checked.

For an *independent* decode check — our parser agreeing with our serializer
proves little — Node's resolver is c-ares and takes a port in the server string:

```js
const r = new (require('dns').Resolver)();
r.setServers(['127.0.0.1:15353']);
r.resolve4('www.example.com', console.log);
```

**dnspython is installed on this machine** (2.8.0, `pip install dnspython`) and is
the better tool for anything cryptographic, because its TSIG is interop-tested
against BIND — it signs, verifies, and does AXFR with a keyring, so it can be put
on either side of an exchange. It is *not* a project dependency; it exists so a
third party can disagree with us:

```python
import dns.message, dns.query, dns.tsig, dns.tsigkeyring, dns.name, dns.zone
ring = dns.tsigkeyring.from_text({'transfer.key.': 'BASE64SECRET'})
q = dns.message.make_query('example.com', 'SOA')
q.use_tsig(ring, keyname=dns.name.from_text('transfer.key.'),
           algorithm=dns.tsig.HMAC_SHA256)
print(dns.query.udp(q, '127.0.0.1', port=15353))          # verifies the reply's TSIG
dns.zone.from_xfr(dns.query.xfr('127.0.0.1', 'example.com', port=15353,
                                keyring=ring,
                                keyname=dns.name.from_text('transfer.key.')))
```

This is the check the DNSSEC work did not have and should have: a MAC or a
signature over a canonical serialization is the one thing that cannot be verified
by both halves of your own code agreeing.

Four environment traps that have each cost an hour:

- **PowerShell 5.1 `-shl` keeps the left operand's `[byte]` type and truncates**,
  so `$b[0] -shl 8` is **0**. Cast to `[int]` first, or every 2-byte field you
  decode by hand is silently wrong.
- **Never round-trip a source file through `Get-Content`/`Set-Content` in PS
  5.1.** It reads UTF-8 as cp1252 and writes it back as UTF-8, double-encoding
  every non-ASCII character, and adds a BOM. Use the editor, not the shell.
- **`Copy-Item` preserves the source file's timestamp**, so a restored file can
  look older than the build artifacts; cargo then skips recompiling and the test
  run reports the *previous* build's results. Touch the file or
  `cargo clean -p rdns` before trusting numbers after a copy.
- **Windows hands out ephemeral ports sequentially** from a rotating cursor, and
  TCP and UDP have exclusion blocks at *different* ranges
  (`netsh int ipv4 show excludedportrange tcp|udp`). "Bind port 0 on one
  protocol, then match that port on the other" can fail for every attempt in a
  row; `resolver.rs`'s test helpers scan fixed ports at 20000+ instead.

---

## Open work

### 1. Recursor follow-ups — done
Aggressive NSEC caching (RFC 8198) landed; see "Architecture: aggressive use"
and "Done so far". Everything else under #1 — async conversion, QNAME
minimization, 0x20 + reply validation, RTT-based server selection, IPv6
hints/glue and the `--root-hints` flag — was already done.

The recursor is covered by 51 tests in `resolver.rs` (see "Architecture: the
resolver") and the denial cache by 16 in `nsec_cache.rs`.

Two things aggressive use deliberately does **not** do, either of which is a
reasonable next step:

- [ ] **No wildcard synthesis.** RFC 8198 §5.3 also allows *positive* answers to
      be synthesized from a validated wildcard record. Not done: it needs the
      closest-encloser machinery on the positive path and interacts with the
      unfinished wildcard-NSEC item under #2.
- [ ] **NSEC3 covers NODATA but its NXDOMAIN path is untested against a real
      zone.** The closest-encloser proof is implemented and unit-tested, but
      every NSEC3 test here builds its own records; no NSEC3 zone has been
      resolved end to end the way the NSEC one has.

### 2. DNSSEC follow-ups
Validation is on the resolve path and enforced (see "Architecture: DNSSEC" and
"Done so far"). What is left is narrower than what landed:

- [ ] **No RFC 5011 automated key rollover.** A root KSK roll needs either a new
      build or a new `--trust-anchor` file. RFC 5011 tracks the new key from the
      zone itself during an overlap window.
      *Cheaper than this item used to claim.* The "persistent state" it needs is
      what Unbound keeps in `auto-trust-anchor-file:` — one small writable text
      file of key states and timestamps, rewritten as keys roll. Not a database,
      and no interaction with zone storage at all: `TrustAnchors::parse` and
      `from_file` already exist, so it is a writer plus the state machine. It is
      the most self-contained item left on this list.
- [ ] **CNAME chains are validated per-RRset, not as a chain.** Each RRset must
      verify under the keys of the zone that signed it, which is checked — but
      nothing verifies that the chain of CNAMEs itself is the one the client
      asked for beyond the existing `chain` filter in `recurse`.
- [ ] **`rdnsd` cannot sign a zone**, only serve one that arrives pre-signed,
      and `dnssec_validation_mode` is still not called from anywhere.

### 3. NSEC3 salt and iterations — done
Was: `validate_nsec3` hashed the query name with a single bare SHA-1 pass,
ignoring the salt and iteration count it had already parsed. Now
`dnssec_denial::nsec3_hash` implements RFC 5155 §5 properly and is checked
against the RFC's own Appendix A vectors. Iterations are capped at 150
(RFC 9276); above that the hash is refused, which reads as insecure rather than
bogus — a zone that signs itself unreasonably is not evidence of an attack.

### 4. Zone lookup — done
Was: `Zone::query` filtered the whole record vector per query, and `matches_query`
normalized and lower-cased both names into fresh `String`s for every record it
touched — 20k allocations for one lookup on a 10k-record zone, measured at
**4.4 ms**. Now indexed by owner name at load time: **0.685 µs**, and
`bench_zone_lookup` guards the regression. See "Architecture: zone storage".

### 5. Smaller open items
- [x] **AXFR** — done, see "Done so far" and "Architecture: zone transfer".
- [x] **TSIG** (RFC 8945) — done, see "Architecture: TSIG". A key authorizes a
      transfer from any address, and every signed query gets a signed answer.
      Neither `rdnsr` nor `rdnsc` signs anything yet: TSIG is server-side only, so
      there is no way to *send* a signed query from this workspace except from a
      test.
- [x] **NOTIFY** (RFC 1996) — done, see "Architecture: NOTIFY". `--also-notify`
      tells a secondary at once instead of leaving it to the refresh timer, and an
      incoming NOTIFY is answered as a NOTIFY.
- [ ] **IXFR** (RFC 1995) — moved to #7, where it belongs: it is an optimisation
      inside the secondary story rather than a feature of its own. Two things about
      it are worth knowing before starting there. A request currently **cannot even
      be received** — `validation.rs:128` rejects any request with a non-empty
      authority section, and an IXFR request carries the client's SOA there. And a
      server may *always* answer AXFR-style instead (RFC 1995 §4), which NSD did as
      a primary for years, so the conformant first version needs no journal at all.
- [x] **Amplification** — the response byte budget is in (`--response-rate`, UDP);
      see "Done so far" and "Architecture: amplification". `rdnsd` still binds
      `0.0.0.0` by default, which is the right default for an authoritative server
      and the reason the budget matters.
      (Note: the resolver's outbound source port is already randomized via
      `UdpSocket::bind("0.0.0.0:0")`. Do **not** "fix" the servers to reply from
      a random port — a reply must come from the port the query was sent to.)
- [x] Plain RFC 2308 negative caching — done, see "Done so far". `rdnsr` still
      caches only the answer section of a *positive* answer: authority and
      additional records (delegation NS sets, glue) are dropped, so a referral
      learned mid-resolution is not reusable except through the delegation cache.
- [x] Zone parser: `$INCLUDE` and parenthesized multi-line records — done, see
      "Done so far". Still missing from the parser: TTL unit suffixes (`1h`,
      `2d`), `\`-escaped dots inside a label, and `@` as an rdata name.
- [x] TXT `<character-string>` framing — done, see "Done so far".

### 7. The secondary role — replication, in six steps

`rdnsd` is a standalone primary: it reads zone files, serves them, hands out copies
(AXFR) and announces changes (NOTIFY). It cannot be the *other* end of any of that.
Adding the client half makes it a replica in a single-writer, asynchronous,
pull-based replication topology — one primary holds the editable copy, secondaries
are read-only, NOTIFY is a wake-up hint rather than a data channel, and there is no
election or conflict resolution because a replica never accepts writes. It also
composes: a secondary can serve AXFR of a zone it fetched and NOTIFY further
downstream, so one binary can be any node in a replication tree.

What the client actually does, per (zone, master): load the local copy and its last
refresh time → ask the master for the zone's SOA → compare serials (RFC 1982) →
transfer if behind (AXFR, or IXFR with our SOA in the authority section) → verify,
assemble, **swap in atomically** → persist → sleep on the SOA's REFRESH, RETRY and
EXPIRE, with a NOTIFY short-circuiting the wait. EXPIRE is the one with teeth: out
of contact past it, a secondary must **stop answering** rather than serve stale
authoritative data.

The steps, in decreasing value per line:

- [ ] **1. Serve both transports in one process.** The prerequisite, and good on its
      own: `rdnsd udp` and `rdnsd tcp` are separate processes today, and writable
      state needs a single owner — two of them transferring the same zone and racing
      to write it is not a design to grow into. `rdnsr` already does this. Merging
      also lets the rate limiter, validator, logger and metrics be *shared* rather
      than one set per transport, which is what they should have been.
- [ ] **2. A zone-file writer**, plus the write-temp-then-rename helper. Independently
      useful for dumping and debugging, and required by everything below. Text
      presentation format, so the load path is the one already parsed and tested.
- [ ] **3. Secondary role, AXFR-only.** Master configuration, refresh/retry/expire
      timers, an AXFR client (the TSIG client primitives `sign_request` and
      `check_response` already exist and are used only by tests), the state sidecar,
      per-zone atomic swap, and acting on a NOTIFY instead of answering NOTAUTH.
- [ ] **4. IXFR-out** from in-memory diffs computed at load time — BIND's
      `ixfr-from-differences` semantics without an on-disk journal.
- [ ] **5. IXFR-in**, which needs step 3's timers and step 4's delta handling.
- [ ] **6. Persisted deltas**, only if dynamic UPDATE (RFC 2136) ever arrives — that
      is what really needs a journal, because then the journal *is* the source of
      truth between file syncs.

**One simplification worth not re-deriving.** Applying a transfer does not need a
record-removal API on `Zone`, and it is worth never adding one: the index holds
*positions* into the record vector, so removal shifts every later position. A full
AXFR is "build a new `Zone`, swap it in". An IXFR delta is "build a new `Zone` from
the old records minus the deletes plus the adds, swap it in" — O(zone size) per
transfer rather than per record, which at any zone size this serves is nothing.

### 6. Candidate: special-use names in `rdnsr` (RFC 6761)

Not required by anything here, and the smallest step towards `rdnsr` being usable
as a real system resolver. Right now every one of these leaves the machine and
goes to the root servers:

- [ ] **`localhost` must resolve locally** — 127.0.0.1 / ::1, and must *never* be
      sent upstream (RFC 6761 §6.3).
- [ ] **`*.local` is mDNS, not DNS** (RFC 6762 §3) — the honest answer is REFUSED
      or NXDOMAIN, immediately. Today it costs a full walk to the root, fails
      slowly, and tells the root what LAN names are being looked up.
- [ ] **Private-address reverse lookups** — `10.in-addr.arpa`,
      `16-31.172.in-addr.arpa`, `168.192.in-addr.arpa`, `254.169.in-addr.arpa`,
      and the v6 equivalents — should be answered NXDOMAIN locally (RFC 6303).
      Leaking them exposes internal addressing and hammers AS112.
- [ ] Also in RFC 6761: `invalid.` (always NXDOMAIN), `example.`/`example.com`/
      `.net`/`.org` (ordinary, no special handling), and `10.in-addr.arpa` friends
      above.

Perhaps a hundred lines and a table, entirely inside this codebase's existing
shape — unlike the rest of what a system resolver needs.

**The rest of that ambition is deliberately not on this list**, because it is not
DNS: dynamic upstreams and per-link split DNS from DHCP/NetworkManager/
systemd-networkd (reconfiguring live when a VPN or a new Wi-Fi network appears),
mDNS/LLMNR responding, DNS-over-TLS, a `resolvectl`-style control surface
(flush-caches, statistics), privilege dropping and a systemd unit, and listening
on 127.0.0.1 *and* ::1 at once — `rdnsr` binds one host:port
(`rdnsr/src/main.rs:204`). That is a network-configuration daemon that happens to
speak DNS, and it is a bigger project than this one. Smaller gaps in the same
direction, if it is ever picked up: no opcode check (an UPDATE or NOTIFY is
treated as a query rather than answered NOTIMP), no admission control on the UDP
path (a task per datagram, unbounded — TCP has both caps), no rate limiting or
query logging in `rdnsr` at all (both exist in the library, wired into `rdnsd`
only), no signal handling, no EDNS cookies (RFC 7873), and static root hints with
no periodic re-priming of the root NS set.

---

## Architecture: the resolver

One `Resolver` type with `ResolverMode::{Recurse, Forward}`, chosen by config —
not two programs. That is how BIND, Unbound, Knot Resolver and PowerDNS Recursor
all model it, and for the same reasons: the client-facing half is identical, only
the means of obtaining an answer differs, and mixed deployments (forward one
zone, recurse the rest) need both in one process. `rdnsr` recurses by default;
any `--upstream` selects forwarding.

**Recursion** walks root hints → TLD → authoritative, following referrals. The
built-in hints carry both an A and an AAAA for each of the 13 roots, interleaved
so whichever family the host has is reached early; `query_server` binds its send
socket to the target's family (a v4-wildcard socket cannot reach a v6 address),
which is what makes AAAA glue usable at all. `parse_root_hints` loads the
`named.root` format for `rdnsr --root-hints`. Three controls are load-bearing:

- **Bailiwick on referrals.** A referral must be below the zone we asked and at
  or above the name being chased, or `com.` could hand us the servers for
  somebody else's zone.
- **Bailiwick on glue**, judged against the *responding server's own* zone rather
  than the zone being delegated to. This distinction is the whole ballgame at the
  root: the referral to `com.` carries glue for `a.gtld-servers.net.`, which is
  not under `com.` at all, and rejecting it breaks bootstrapping outright —
  resolving `gtld-servers.net.` needs `net.`, whose glue is also
  `gtld-servers.net.`. Against the root's own zone it is properly in bailiwick.
  A `com.` server gets no such latitude.
- **A total query budget**, not merely a depth limit. This is the NXNSAttack
  (2020) defence: a hostile zone can name dozens of glueless nameservers, each
  costing a full resolution, so bounding the total is what stops one client query
  from becoming hundreds of upstream ones.

Also: answers are filtered to the chain actually asked about (the name in hand
plus CNAME targets already accepted), because `rdnsr` caches what comes back and
records volunteered for unrelated names are a cache-poisoning attempt. A response
with no answer, no AA and no usable referral is an error, not a pass-through — an
empty NOERROR reads as a definitive "no such record", which a lame delegation is
not.

**Reply validation** guards every response `query_server` accepts: the
transaction id must match, and the echoed question must be the name we sent.
With **0x20 case randomization** on (`zero_x20`, default on) the outgoing name's
letter case is scrambled and the question check is case-sensitive, so an off-path
spoofer has to reproduce the casing on top of the id and the random source port;
off, the check is the ordinary case-insensitive one. A mismatch is treated as no
answer, so `ask_any` moves to the next server. Turn 0x20 off for the rare
authoritative server or middlebox that does not preserve case.

**QNAME minimization (RFC 9156)** is on by default (`qname_minimization`, off to
send the full name every hop). Each hop asks the current servers only for the
next label down toward the target — `com.`, then `example.com.`, then the leaf —
so the root learns the TLD and no more, and the full name reaches only the
server authoritative for it. Intermediate probes use QTYPE=NS: a zone cut answers
with a referral, a plain in-zone name with NODATA, telling the two apart without
disclosing the leaf. An empty non-terminal (a name with descendants but no
records of its own) returns NODATA to the NS probe, so the walk deepens by a
label and re-asks the same servers rather than mistaking it for a final answer;
that costs one extra probe per such label. NXDOMAIN on an ancestor ends the walk
— the whole subtree is empty (RFC 8020). Bailiwick is still judged against the
full target name, so minimizing the query does not widen what a referral may
claim.

**The delegation cache** (`DelegationCache`) keeps the servers learned per zone,
keyed by zone name with the referral's shortest TTL, capped at a day. A
resolution starts at the deepest cached ancestor of the name rather than at the
root: knowing `example.com.` beats knowing `com.` because it skips a round trip.
A cached delegation that fails is dropped and the walk restarts from the root, so
stale bookkeeping degrades to slow rather than broken. `delegation_cache_size`
(10k default, 0 disables). Verified: three queries into one zone consult the root
exactly once.

**Server selection** within a zone is fastest-first, not round-robin or
learned-order. `RttStore` keeps a smoothed round-trip time per server address
(EWMA, α=0.25, the RFC 6298 SRTT factor); `ask_any` orders the candidates by it,
times each round trip, and charges a failure the full timeout so a dead server
sinks to the back after one attempt. Unmeasured servers sort at a middling
default (`UNKNOWN_RTT_MS`), so a fresh set is tried in the order given, a
measured-fast server beats an untried one, and an untried one beats a known-bad
one. The store shares the delegation cache's capacity, evicting the slowest
entry when full; a resolution keeps preferring the fast server and only re-tries
a demoted one once the fast one also fails (no active re-probing yet).

**Forwarding** sends RD=1 to each configured upstream and returns the first
answer, going through the same `ask_any` (so upstreams are RTT-ordered too).
Recursion sends RD=0 — an authoritative server has no business recursing for us,
and asking it to is how open resolvers get abused.

Tests (36 in `resolver.rs`) stand up a fake root/TLD/authoritative hierarchy
in-process. They share one port across distinct loopback addresses, because glue
carries an address and no port — which is also why `server_port` exists in the
config.

## Architecture: DNSSEC

Four modules, split by what they know rather than by record type:

| module | what it answers |
|--------|-----------------|
| `dnssec` | do these bytes verify under this key; does this DNSKEY hash to this DS |
| `dnssec_denial` | does this NSEC/NSEC3 actually deny the thing being claimed |
| `dnssec_chain` | trust anchors, and the verdict for one step of the chain |
| `resolver` | fetching, ordering, caching — the async half |

`dnssec_chain` is deliberately synchronous and takes records as arguments;
fetching them means asking servers, which is the resolver's job. The resolver
drives the loop and calls in at each step. That split is what makes the chain
logic testable without a socket.

**The load-bearing function is `dnssec::signed_data`.** A signature is not over
the RRset as it arrived; it is over `RRSIG_RDATA(signature field removed) ||
canonical RRset` (RFC 4035 §5.3.2), where canonical means the RRSIG's *original*
TTL rather than the received one, owner names down-cased, a wildcard-expanded
owner replaced by the wildcard that was really signed, embedded names down-cased
for the RFC 4034 §6.2 types, and the records sorted by canonical RDATA with
duplicates dropped. Sorting is by RDATA **alone**, not by the encoded RR: RDLEN
sits between the fixed prefix and the RDATA, so sorting whole records orders by
length first and puts a short RDATA ahead of a longer one that precedes it.

**Four states, and the two that matter are Insecure and Bogus.** Insecure means
the chain legitimately ended — a zone *proved* it has no DS — and is the normal
case for most of the internet; the answer is served without AD. Bogus means the
chain was supposed to continue and did not, and the answer is withheld. Conflate
them and you either break the unsigned internet or launder attacks. Indeterminate
is a third thing again: no trust anchor covers the name, so there was never a
chain to walk.

**DS is collected during the walk, not asked for afterwards.** A referral is the
only moment the *parent's* side of a zone cut is in front of us. Querying the
child for its own DS lets the child answer a question about itself; querying the
parent again costs a round trip already spent. So `walk` reads each referral's
authority section into `Resolution::cuts` as it goes past, and validation
consumes what the walk collected. This is also why the delegation-cache shortcut
is narrowed when validating: skipping ahead to a cached zone also skips the cut
above it, so `best_start` only jumps to a zone whose keys are already validated —
and `establish_chain` resumes at exactly the same place, or the two disagree and
an answer that validated a moment ago comes back bogus.

**A stripped DS must be bogus, not insecure.** Delete the DS records from a
referral and a naive validator concludes "unsigned zone, nothing to check",
downgrading every signed zone beneath it. So the absence of a DS is only
believed when the parent *proves* it with a signed NSEC/NSEC3 — and the proof is
verified as an RRset like any other, because an attacker can write NSEC records
too. Opt-out (RFC 5155 §6) is the one case where a merely *covering* NSEC3
suffices, and only with the flag actually set.

**A wildcard answer is not finished when its signature verifies.** A wildcard is
signed at `*.example.com.`, and the labels field in the RRSIG says so — which
means the same RRset and signature verify at *every* name that wildcard could
expand to. Re-own a genuine `*.example.com. A` RRset onto any name under
`example.com.` and the cryptography still checks out. So a verified expansion
carries an obligation out of `validate_records` (as `RecordsVerdict::wildcards`)
and `validate_wildcard_proofs` discharges it against a signed NSEC/NSEC3, which
must show two things: the name asked about has no records of its own, and the
wildcard used is the one its *closest encloser* publishes. The second half is
the one that is easy to miss — `b.example.com.`'s own NSEC covers
`a.b.example.com.`, because a name sorts before everything beneath it, so
"some NSEC covers the name" would accept a `*.example.com.` answer for a name
that `b.example.com.` governs. For NSEC that is checked by deriving the closest
encloser from the covering record; NSEC3 gets it for free, since the name it has
to cover — the next closer — is named from where the wildcard sits (RFC 5155
§8.8). An Opt-Out NSEC3 there yields Insecure rather than Bogus: it declines to
say whether a delegation is in the span, which is not a proof and not an attack.

**And the same thing on the negative side.** A NODATA answer usually rests on the
NSEC *at* the name, whose bitmap lists the types it has. But the name may not
exist at all, a wildcard may be what answered, and it may have had no record of
this type either — so the proof is a different pair: the name shown absent, and
the record at the wildcard showing what a wildcard would have carried (RFC 4035
§5.4, RFC 5155 §8.7). Demanding only the first shape refuses a legitimate answer,
which is what `proves_nodata` did: any zone with a wildcard got SERVFAIL for
every type the wildcard does not hold. The depth check matters here for the same
reason as on the positive side — `*.example.com.`'s bitmap says nothing about a
name that `b.example.com.` governs.

Two things that fall out of this and are worth not re-deriving. A record sitting
*at* a wildcard is not an expansion of it — the labels field never counts the
leading `*` (RFC 4034 §3.1.3), so the arithmetic alone flags the wildcard's own
RRset, and demanding a proof that `*.example.com.` does not exist would break
every wildcard-aware denial, since those carry exactly that record.
`is_wildcard_expansion` therefore compares against the name that was signed.
And the proof may arrive with an *earlier* hop of a CNAME chase, whose authority
section does not survive into the message we return, so `Resolution` accumulates
NSEC/NSEC3 records across hops the same way it accumulates zone cuts.

**The key cache stores conclusions, not material.** `KeyCache` holds DNSKEY sets
that have already been validated to an anchor, so a second query into a zone
costs no revalidation. That makes its TTL load-bearing, hence the one-day cap.

Failure is closed: `rdnsr` answers SERVFAIL on bogus, and never caches an answer
as validated that was not. A client setting CD gets the data unfiltered
(RFC 4035 §3.2.2) — it has said it validates for itself. AD goes out only for a
Secure answer and only to a client that set DO or AD (RFC 6840 §5.8), and a
client that did not set DO gets no DNSSEC records at all (RFC 4035 §3.2.1).

**Algorithms:** ECDSA P-256/P-384 (13/14), RSA/SHA-256 and SHA-512 (8/10),
Ed25519 (15), and RSA/SHA-1 (5/7) because a long tail of zones still uses it.
Anything else — RSAMD5, DSA, GOST, Ed448 — is *unsupported*, which per RFC 4035
§5.2 makes the delegation insecure rather than bogus: we have no basis to call an
answer forged when we simply cannot read the signature.

**Testing.** Port 53 is intercepted here (see "Verifying"), so there is no live
signed zone to point at — which is precisely how this code came to be written
without a genuine signature ever reaching it. `dnssec_test_util` generates real
keys with `ring` and signs at test time; `resolver.rs` stands up a signed
root → `test.` → `example.test.` hierarchy in-process and drives the whole
resolve path through it, including the substituted-answer, unvouched-key,
stripped-DS and proven-unsigned cases.

## Architecture: aggressive use of validated denials (RFC 8198)

An NSEC record does not say "this name does not exist". It says "nothing exists
between these two names", and it is signed. A validator holding one therefore
already knows the answer for *every* name in that gap, and asking the
authoritative server again learns nothing it was not already told. `NsecCache`
caches the gap rather than the question, which turns a flood of random names
under one zone — a water-torture attack, or an ordinary typo storm — from one
upstream query per name into one query per zone.

This could not be bolted onto `DnsCache`. That maps `(name, type)` to records
and can only answer the question it was asked; a gap has to be searched by
*range*. So the proofs live in a `BTreeMap` ordered by
`dnssec_denial::canonical_sort_key` — a byte encoding of the labels right to
left, each terminated by a zero byte, whose plain `Ord` is exactly RFC 4034
§6.1 canonical order. A covering lookup is then `range(..=key).next_back()`,
falling back to the last entry for the record that wraps to the apex.

Everything here is a way of *not* asking, so every mistake is invisible until it
denies a name that exists. Five rules keep that from happening:

- **Only Secure material is stored.** `rdnsr` inserts a denial only when
  validation returned Secure. An unvalidated NSEC is an attacker's assertion
  about which names do not exist, which is a denial-of-service primitive.
- **Never across an opt-out NSEC3 span** (RFC 8198 §5.2). Opt-out means the span
  may contain delegations the zone never named. Refused at *insert* rather than
  at lookup, so no code path can consult one.
- **Never below a delegation.** This one is not in the RFC's list and is the
  easiest to get wrong. A gap says nothing exists *in this zone* between its
  endpoints; if its lower edge is a delegation (NS set, SOA clear), everything
  under that name lives in the child zone — and those names sort *inside* the
  gap, because `sub.example.com.` and `x.sub.example.com.` are canonically
  adjacent. Synthesizing there denies an entire zone we were never authoritative
  for. `ZoneProofs::covering_nsec` refuses it, and a test pins the ordering fact
  that makes it possible.
- **NXDOMAIN needs the wildcard denied too**, or a name the gap covers could
  still have been answered by a wildcard higher up. Rather than re-derive that
  argument, the cache gathers the candidate records and hands them to the same
  `dnssec_denial::proves_nxdomain` that validated them — a second implementation
  would drift from the first.
- **TTL is bounded by the proof**, not by the question: the minimum of the
  proof records' remaining life and the SOA's negative TTL (RFC 2308 §5),
  applied in one place to every record going out, so a client cannot re-cache a
  proof for longer than we may hold it.

At a delegation point the parent holds only the DS, so a NODATA there is
synthesized for QTYPE=DS and refused for anything else — the real answer to
those is a referral. ANY and RRSIG are never synthesized: neither can be
reasoned about from a type bitmap.

`rdnsr` checks the denial cache *before* the answer cache, and skips it entirely
for a client with CD set — that client asked us not to filter on its behalf, and
an answer we invented from cached proofs is exactly that. The cache is sized to
zero unless `--dnssec-validate` is on, the same zero-capacity idiom `--no-cache`
uses, so there is no configuration in which unvalidated proofs can enter it.

## Architecture: what `rdnsr` remembers

Three caches, because there are three shapes of thing to remember and one map
cannot hold them:

| cache | key | holds |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `DnsCache` | (name, type) | the records that answered |
| `NegativeCache` | name, or (name, type) | that there were none (RFC 2308) |
| `NsecCache` | a *range* of names | a signed statement that none of them exist (RFC 8198) |

`NegativeCache` is not redundant with `NsecCache`. The denial cache holds
validated material only — everything it does rests on the proof having been
checked — so it is sized to zero unless `--dnssec-validate` is on, which for most
deployments means negative answers were not cached at all and every repeat of a
failing lookup was a fresh walk to the authoritative server.

The two kinds of "no" are keyed differently because they say different things.
**NXDOMAIN** is about the name: no type at it exists, and nothing below it does
either, since a name with descendants would be an empty non-terminal answering
NODATA (RFC 8020 — the resolver's walk already stops on an ancestor's NXDOMAIN,
and a cache that disagreed with the walk would be the odd one out). The lookup is
therefore a walk up the ancestors, bounded by the label count. **NODATA** is about
one type at a name that does exist, so it is keyed by both and says nothing about
any other type.

Three rules keep it honest. **An SOA is required** — RFC 2308 §5 takes the
negative TTL from it, so a "no" that arrives without one never said how long it
was good for; this is also what keeps a referral out of the cache. **The TTL is
`min(SOA MINIMUM, the SOA record's TTL)`, capped at an hour**, and the records
handed back count down, so a client cannot re-cache a "no" for longer than we may
hold it. **Nothing bogus is stored**, and whether an answer validated is stored
with it, so the AD bit the second client sees is the one the first client saw.

Lookup order in `handle_query` is denials → negatives → answers → resolve. The
denial cache goes first because it answers questions never asked, and is skipped
for a client with CD set for the same reason. The negative cache is not skipped:
it returns the answer *this* question actually got, which is caching rather than
filtering.

`rdnsd` had to change for any of this to work: a negative answer now carries the
zone's SOA in the authority section (RFC 2308 §2.1, §2.2). Without it a
downstream resolver — ours included — has no negative TTL and cannot cache the
answer at all.

## Architecture: persistence

Settled before writing any of #7, because every step below depends on it: **plain
files, no database**, with the format chosen per kind of state.

| state | store | why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| fetched zone data | a text **zone file**, written by us | the format already parsed and tested here; inspectable; what NSD and BIND do |
| per-zone transfer state | a small **line-based text file** (`zone serial last-refresh master`) | keeps operational state out of the interchange format — BIND leans on the file's mtime instead and pays in imprecision |
| IXFR deltas | **in memory**, derived by diffing at load time | zones come from files and reload in discrete events; NSD answered AXFR instead of deltas as a primary for years |
| RFC 5011 anchors | a **writable trust-anchor file** | Unbound's `auto-trust-anchor-file:` model; `TrustAnchors::parse`/`from_file` already exist |

Four rules, and the first is why step 1 of #7 exists at all:

- **One writer per file.** Which means one process: two `rdnsd`s over the same zone
  cannot both own writable state.
- **Write a temporary file, then rename.** `std::fs::rename` replaces an existing
  file on both Unix and Windows, so this is portable; the fsync-the-directory
  refinement is POSIX-only.
- **Nothing on the query path touches disk.** Memory stays authoritative for
  answering — the zone index is 0.685 µs a lookup and must stay that way. Disk
  exists to survive a restart, nothing else.
- **Missing or corrupt state degrades, never crashes.** No state file means "never
  refreshed", which means fetch. The same posture the caches already take: when in
  doubt, go and ask.

**Why not SQL or LMDB.** PowerDNS is database-backed because in its deployments the
*source of truth* is a provisioning system's database; here it is a zone file. SQL
would add a C dependency and a schema-migration story to persist a few kilobytes,
buy nothing on the hot path (the in-memory index stays either way, so the database
is an expensive file), and cost the dependency-light character of the rest of this
codebase. LMDB is Knot's choice and right *at Knot's scale* — journals, catalog
zones, key state, hundreds of thousands of zones; this serves single digits. Three
triggers would change the answer: thousands of zones, dynamic UPDATE at a real
write rate, or an external system owning the data.

**What the others actually persist**, since it is the evidence for the table above:
NSD keeps `xfrd.state` for serials and transfer times and rewrites secondary zones
into their zone files hourly; BIND keeps a per-zone `.jnl` journal (dynamic UPDATE,
IXFR both ways, inline signing) plus managed-key files for RFC 5011; Knot puts
journal, timers and key state in LMDB. And the surprise: **neither BIND nor Unbound
persists its resolver cache** — `dumpdb`/`dump_cache` are inspection tools, and
Unbound's only real answer is the optional Redis-backed `cachedb` module. Knot
Resolver is the outlier that does (LMDB on disk). So `rdnsr` losing its cache on
restart is mainstream rather than a gap, and is the one store on this page not to
build.

## Architecture: zone storage

Records live in one vector; an index built as they are added maps the absolute,
down-cased owner name to the positions of the records at it. `origin` and
`records` are private because the index is derived from both — a record appended
behind its back, or an origin changed without a rebuild, leaves the zone
answering NXDOMAIN for data it holds, which is a bug this repo has already had
once. `$ORIGIN` mid-file therefore goes through `set_origin`, which re-keys what
is already loaded, keeping the result identical to resolving every relative name
against the final origin (what the query-time normalization used to do).

**Keyed by name, not by (name, type)**, though the TODO item said the latter. A
server needs two questions answered and the second is what tells NXDOMAIN from
NODATA: "which records of this type sit at this name", and "does this name exist
at all". A (name, type) map answers the first and cannot answer the second
without probing 65535 types; the records at a single name are a handful, so
picking a type out of them costs nothing measurable. It is also how NSD and Knot
hold a zone — a node per name, carrying its RRsets.

**Owner names are resolved as they are parsed**, not stored relative, so
`ZoneRecord.name` is always absolute for a parsed zone. That is what makes
`$ORIGIN` apply to the lines below it (RFC 1035 §5.1) and what gives `$INCLUDE`'s
optional origin argument something to mean. `Zone::set_origin` still re-keys,
because a record added through the API may carry a relative name.

**Reading the file is two passes.** `logical_lines` turns physical lines into
logical ones first: comments stripped, quoted strings respected, and lines joined
while parentheses are open. Parentheses are not cosmetic — every real SOA is
written across five lines — and `;` inside a quoted string is data, which matters
because TXT records are mostly semicolons. `$INCLUDE` then recurses, with the
origin and default TTL copied in and nothing copied back (RFC 1035 §5.1 requires
exactly that for the origin), a depth cap to catch a file that includes itself,
and relative paths resolved next to the including file — which is why
`parse_zone_file_at` exists alongside `parse_zone_file`.

**Wildcards are one extra lookup**, not a scan: the queried name's first label
replaced by `*`. A wildcard covers exactly one label (RFC 4592 §2.1.1), so that
single probe is the whole of wildcard matching — and it is consulted *only* when
the name itself has no records, because an existing name shadows the wildcard
entirely, including for types it does not carry (RFC 1034 §4.3.3, RFC 4592
§2.2.1). The old scan returned the exact and the wildcard records together,
merging two owners' data into one RRset; that is fixed as a side effect of having
to decide the question.

## Architecture: amplification

Two limiters, because there are two different quantities to bound and the second
one is what a reflection attack is measured in.

`RateLimiter` counts **queries** per client: 100 per 10 s, burst 20. That is a
fairness limit, and it is blind to amplification — a query is a query whether the
answer is 60 bytes or 4000, so a client staying inside it can still have the
server emit 25 KB/s at whatever address it claims to be.

`ResponseLimiter` counts **bytes going out** per client: `--response-rate`, 8 KiB/s
by default with a four-second burst. The burst is what keeps ordinary use out of
it — a page load is a dozen names at once — while the sustained rate is what an
attacker would need and cannot get.

Over budget, the response is **truncated rather than dropped**, one in every two
(the *slip* of BIND's Response Rate Limiting; RFC 5358 is the reflector problem
itself). A truncated reply carries no records and measured 42 bytes against the
44-byte query that asked for it, so it cannot amplify — and RFC 1035 §4.2.1 has a
real client retry over TCP, where the handshake proves the source address and the
budget stops applying. Dropping every over-budget response instead would leave a
legitimate client with nothing but a timeout and no hint that TCP would work;
answering every one of them would make the refusal itself the reflector.

The per-client table is **bounded** (10k addresses). A spoofed flood arrives from
every address there is, so unbounded tracking would be the next thing to exhaust;
past the bound the limiter stops growing and truncates instead, which is small,
still answerable over TCP, and no longer proportional to the number of forged
sources.

Measured on a zone with a 2.5 KB TXT RRset, one address, 5.5 s at 200 queries/s:
**32.7 KB/s** of responses with the budget off against **13.2 KB/s** with the
default — the 8 KB/s rate plus the 32 KB burst spread over the window, which is
the arithmetic working rather than a leak.

## Architecture: NOTIFY

A NOTIFY is not a query, and that is the whole of the difference. The opcode is 4
rather than 0, so a server dispatching on nothing but the question section answers
it as a lookup for the zone's SOA — a plausible reply to a message that asked
nothing. `rdnsd` dispatches on the opcode now: QUERY goes to the zone lookup,
NOTIFY is answered as a NOTIFY, and everything else (UPDATE, STATUS, the obsolete
IQUERY) gets NOTIMP instead of being treated as a lookup.

**Sending** is on zone load — startup, and SIGHUP where signals exist — for every
zone whose serial moved *forward*, compared against what was last announced.
Unchanged is not news; backwards is not either, since a secondary compares serials
and would ignore it. The comparison is RFC 1982 serial arithmetic, so a serial
wrapping past 2^32 still reads as an increment rather than as a rollback that would
silence the zone forever. The message carries the zone's SOA (RFC 1996 §3.7 makes
that optional) because it saves the secondary a question. Retries are bounded and
any rcode ends them: a secondary answering NOTAUTH has still received it. The
targets are exactly what `--also-notify` lists — not the zone's NS set, which BIND
derives and which would mean sending to whatever a zone happens to name.

Messages are built under the zone lock and sent outside it: an unanswered NOTIFY
takes seconds to retry, and holding the map that long would block a reload behind
the network.

**Receiving** is answered NOTAUTH, because it is the truth — this server is a
primary, with no secondary role, no master to be told by and nothing to fetch. The
attempt is logged either way, distinguishing a zone we serve from one we do not: a
NOTIFY from an unexpected source is worth seeing (RFC 1996 §3.10 has a secondary
log exactly that).

## Architecture: TSIG

A TSIG is not a record, it is a *pseudo*-record: appended as the last entry of the
additional section, covering the message it is attached to. Verifying one means
removing it again and hashing what is left — which is why `tsig.rs` works on bytes
rather than on a parsed `DnsMessage`. A re-serialized message is not necessarily
the same bytes (name compression is a choice), and the MAC is over the bytes that
were actually sent. `find_tsig` walks the wire format to locate the record,
`strip_tsig` reproduces the message as it was before signing (ARCOUNT one lower,
the signer's own id restored — a forwarder may have rewritten the one on the
wire), and `append_tsig` puts one on.

What the digest covers (RFC 8945 §4.3.3, §5.4.2):

```text
request:   message-without-TSIG || TSIG variables
response:  2-byte length || request MAC || message-without-TSIG || TSIG variables
envelope:  2-byte length || previous MAC || message-without-TSIG || timers only
```

The **request MAC in the response's digest** is the part that matters: it binds
the answer to the question, so a reply cannot be replayed as the reply to
something else. For a zone transfer the MACs **chain** — each envelope over the
previous one, and the messages after the first hash only the timers (§5.3.1) — so
a dropped or reordered envelope fails at the client instead of passing for a
complete zone.

**Three failures, and they say different things.** BADKEY: I do not know that key
name, or not with that algorithm — which is also the answer for an algorithm we do
not implement, since either way we cannot check what arrived, and it is what stops
a peer downgrading SHA-256 to SHA-1 by asking. BADSIG: I know the key and the MAC
does not match. BADTIME: the MAC *did* match but the clocks disagree by more than
the fudge. The first two go back unsigned (there is nothing to sign with, or no
reason to believe the sender holds the key); BADTIME is signed and carries this
server's time, so the peer can see which of the two clocks is wrong (§5.2.3).

**Checked before anything answers.** A server that answered the question first and
verified the signature afterwards would be answering questions for whoever asked.

**A truncated MAC is refused** (BADTRUNC) rather than accepted at half length:
that is a policy this server does not have, and the honest failure is better than
a shorter MAC than the operator thinks they configured.

Two deliberate limits. A TSIG that is not the *last* record is treated as no
signature at all, because it does not cover what follows it — accepting one would
be a way to append anything to a signed message. And nothing here signs *outgoing*
queries: `rdnsr` and `rdnsc` have no TSIG support, so the only client in the
workspace is the test suite.

## Architecture: zone transfer

`transfer::axfr_messages` turns a zone into the sequence of messages a transfer
is; who may ask is `security::TransferAcl`'s business, and the two are separate
on purpose — the shape of the answer has nothing to do with the policy, and the
policy is the part that must be impossible to get wrong by accident.

**The framing is the protocol.** A transfer opens with the zone's SOA and closes
with the same SOA (RFC 5936 §2.2). That is not decoration: without the closing
SOA a client cannot tell a complete transfer from a stream that was cut, so the
apex SOA is emitted exactly twice and skipped in the middle. Messages are packed
to a 16 KiB target using an estimate that ignores name compression — an estimate
that can only be too large is the safe direction, since the real limit is the
64 KiB length prefix. Every message repeats the question and stands on its own as
a well-formed authoritative answer (§2.2.1 permits omitting it after the first;
including it is simpler and equally legal). A serialization failure part-way
through abandons the whole transfer rather than sending a prefix of it.

**The ACL defaults to refusing everyone**, which is the opposite of how the rest
of a nameserver works and is the point: an ordinary query leaks one record, an
AXFR leaks the zone. Rules are addresses or CIDR prefixes; families do not mix, so
a v4-mapped v6 peer cannot reach a v4 rule; a malformed rule stops the server
rather than silently shortening the list. Every attempt is logged either way — a
refused transfer is a probe worth seeing, and an allowed one is a copy of the zone
leaving the building.

**Three refusals, three different rcodes.** Not on the list is REFUSED (a policy
decision). A name that is not a zone apex we serve is NOTAUTH — deliberately not
the enclosing-zone lookup an ordinary query does, or asking for
`www.example.com.` would transfer `example.com.`. A zone with no SOA is SERVFAIL,
because there is nothing to bracket the transfer with. Over UDP it is FORMERR: a
whole zone does not fit a datagram and the protocol has no way to say "there is
more", so the request is malformed rather than merely unwelcome.

The TCP server's `answer` returns a *list* of framed messages for this reason.
One task pushes them into the reply channel in order, so a transfer's messages
never reorder among themselves; another query's reply may land between them,
which is legal — a client demultiplexes on the transaction id.

## Architecture: DNS over TCP (both daemons)

Both daemons frame TCP messages with the RFC 1035 §4.2.2 2-byte big-endian
length prefix and keep a connection open for **multiple queries** (RFC 7766
§6.2.1). Shared shape: an accept loop bounded by a 128-permit semaphore (an
unbounded accept-and-spawn loop is a file-descriptor exhaustion vector), a 10 s
idle timeout between messages, and a 5 s timeout to finish a message whose length
prefix has already arrived — a peer mid-message has committed to those bytes, an
idle peer has not. A zero-length frame closes the connection. Neither applies the
EDNS UDP payload size to a TCP reply: the length prefix is the only limit there
(RFC 6891 §6.2.2), and truncating would strand a client that came to TCP
*because* it was truncated.

Both answer a connection's queries **concurrently** (RFC 7766 §6.2.1.1). The
connection splits into read and write halves:

- the read loop parses frames and spawns a task per query;
- each task funnels its framed reply through an `mpsc` channel;
- a single writer task owns the write half, so replies can complete out of order
  (legal — clients match on transaction id) but two framed messages can never
  interleave on the wire.

Both the channel depth and a per-connection semaphore are
`MAX_INFLIGHT_PER_CONNECTION` (16), so a client that pipelines faster than it
reads pushes back on the read loop rather than growing an unbounded task queue.
Dropping the reader's channel sender at loop exit lets the writer drain replies
still in flight and then exit by itself.

**Lock discipline:** the zone-map read guard is scoped to building and
serializing the response and is never held across a socket write — otherwise a
SIGHUP zone reload (a writer) would queue behind a slow client for the life of
its connection.

Concurrency is nearly free on `rdnsd` (an in-memory zone lookup) but is the whole
point on `rdnsr`, where a cache miss costs an upstream round trip. Measured with
`--no-cache`, 8 distinct names on one connection: **172 ms lock-step vs 50 ms
pipelined**.

## Architecture: why `rdnsr` is separate from `rdnsd`

Split following the NSD/Unbound and Knot/Knot-Resolver precedent: opposite trust
models (serving the public versus serving your clients), different data (zones
versus a cache), independent lifecycle, and no risk of an accidental open
resolver. Forwarding versus recursion divides none of those, which is why *that*
is a mode rather than a fifth crate.

`rdnsr` (`rdnsr/src/main.rs`): query → EDNS sanity check (FORMERR / BADVERS) →
`DnsCache` lookup → miss resolves by awaiting `Resolver::resolve` (async; each
upstream round trip is an `await`, no blocking thread) →
cache-store by (name,type)+TTL → reply, echoing the client's txn id with RA set
and OPT mirrored only if the client used EDNS. Cache hits return in 0 ms against
~7 ms for a miss.

It serves UDP *and* TCP on one host:port — both loops are spawned and whichever
fails first takes the process down, so it never silently serves one transport.
TCP is not optional for a resolver: when an answer overflows the client's
advertised UDP payload we reply TC=1, and RFC 1035 §4.2.1 has the client retry
over TCP. The transport reaches `handle_query` as a `Transport` enum whose only
job is picking the response size limit.

Two things `rdnsr` does *not* share with `rdnsd`: it doesn't run the
`RequestValidator`, and it has no zone storage. `--no-cache` is a zero-capacity
`DnsCache` (`put` is a no-op at 0) rather than an `Option`. `--dnssec-validate`
turns on the chain walk described under "Architecture: DNSSEC"; the cache
remembers each entry's validation state alongside it, so an answer served from
cache carries the same AD bit the first client saw and no other.

- **NOTIFY (RFC 1996), and the opcode field was being read wrong** — a secondary
  had no way to hear that a zone changed except its own refresh timer. New `notify`
  module and `--also-notify`: sent on zone load for every zone whose serial moved
  forward (RFC 1982 arithmetic, so a wrap is not read as a rollback), carrying the
  SOA, retried until acknowledged. An incoming NOTIFY is answered *as* a NOTIFY
  with NOTAUTH — this server is a primary, not a secondary — and other opcodes get
  NOTIMP rather than being treated as lookups. See "Architecture: NOTIFY".
- **The opcode decode masked instead of shifting** — `hi & 0x70` where the field
  needs `(hi >> 3) & 0x0f`. It dropped the low bit and never shifted, so IQUERY
  arrived as QUERY, and NOTIFY, UPDATE and STATUS all arrived as `Unknown`; the
  *write* side shifted correctly, so the two disagreed. Invisible because every
  test used QUERY, whose value survives any mask — the same shape as the RRSIG
  expiration/inception swap. NOTIFY could not have worked at all before it.
- **TSIG (RFC 8945)** — `--allow-transfer` authenticates by address, and an address
  is a claim the network makes on a peer's behalf. New `tsig` module: HMAC-SHA1 /
  256 / 384 / 512 over the RFC 8945 digest, `--tsig-key [alg:]name:base64` on both
  subcommands, verification before anything is answered, signed replies to signed
  queries, chained MACs across the envelopes of a zone transfer, and BADKEY /
  BADSIG / BADTIME / BADTRUNC as distinct answers. A key authorizes a transfer from
  any address; the log line says whether a key or an address allowed it.
  Cross-checked against dnspython in both directions, which is the check the DNSSEC
  work never had. See "Architecture: TSIG".
- **A response *byte* budget, not just a query count** — the rate limiter counted
  requests, which is blind to the thing an amplification attack is made of: one
  small query can pull a 2.5 KB answer, and a forged source address turns that
  into someone else's traffic. `security::ResponseLimiter` meters bytes leaving
  per client (`--response-rate`, UDP only — a TCP query has completed a handshake,
  so there is nobody to reflect at), with a four-second burst so ordinary use
  never sees it, and RRL-style *slip*: every second response over budget goes out
  truncated rather than dropped, which cannot amplify and tells a real client to
  retry over TCP. The tracking table is bounded, because a spoofed flood comes
  from every address there is. Measured: 32.7 KB/s out with the budget off,
  13.2 KB/s with it on. See "Architecture: amplification".
- **AXFR (RFC 5936), refused by default** — zone transfer, which the server had no
  handler for at all. The response is the sequence RFC 5936 §2.2 asks for: the SOA
  first, the zone, the same SOA last, split into messages that fit a TCP frame, so
  a client can tell a finished transfer from a cut one. Gated on
  `security::TransferAcl` — addresses or CIDR prefixes, **empty by default, which
  refuses everyone** — and every attempt is logged whether or not it was allowed.
  TCP only: over UDP it is FORMERR, since a zone does not fit a datagram and the
  protocol cannot say "there is more". An AXFR for a name that is not a zone apex
  we serve gets NOTAUTH, not the enclosing zone. See "Architecture: zone transfer".
- **Negative caching, the plain kind (RFC 2308)** — a "no" costs as much to obtain
  as a "yes" and was cached only when it validated, which for most deployments
  meant never: every repeat of a failing lookup was a fresh walk. New
  `NegativeCache` keyed the way each kind of "no" applies — NXDOMAIN by name (all
  types, and everything below it per RFC 8020), NODATA by (name, type) — with the
  TTL from the SOA as RFC 2308 §5 defines it, bounded at an hour, and nothing
  stored without an SOA or from a bogus answer. `rdnsd` now puts its zone's SOA in
  negative answers (RFC 2308 §2.1/§2.2), without which nothing downstream could
  cache them at all. Replaces a `DnsCache::put_negative` stub that stored an empty
  entry under type 0, recorded neither rcode nor SOA, and had no callers. See
  "Architecture: what rdnsr remembers".
- **TXT is framed as `<character-string>`s (RFC 1035 §3.3.14)** — it was stored as
  one unframed blob, so the RDATA on the wire had no length prefix and every
  correct client read the first character of the text as a length byte and lost
  it. `ParsedRecord::TXT` is a `Vec<Vec<u8>>` now: a *sequence*, because two
  strings are not one string joined; and *bytes*, because a character-string is
  arbitrary octets — as `String` a binary TXT failed to decode, and decoding
  happens while reading the message, so one such record made the whole response
  unparseable. The zone parser splits on quotes rather than whitespace (`"a b"` is
  one string, `a b` is two), and a string over 255 bytes fails the load instead of
  being silently split. This also fixes the canonical form, so a signed TXT RRset
  verifies. Confirmed against c-ares.
- **The zone parser reads the files people actually write** — parentheses group a
  record across lines (RFC 1035 §5.1), which every real SOA uses and which used to
  fail the load outright; `;` inside a quoted string is data, not a comment, which
  is what TXT records are full of; and `$INCLUDE <file> [origin]` works, resolved
  next to the including file via the new `parse_zone_file_at`. Owner names are now
  resolved against the origin in force at their line, so `$ORIGIN` applies to what
  follows it rather than retroactively. See "Architecture: zone storage".
- **Zone lookup is indexed** — one `HashMap` from owner name to record positions,
  built at load time, replacing a filter over the whole record vector that
  allocated two `String`s per record compared. 10k-record zone, one lookup:
  **4.4 ms → 0.685 µs** (`bench_zone_lookup` holds the floor). `Zone`'s `origin`
  and `records` are private now, since the index is derived from both. Fixed on
  the way past: an existing name no longer gets the wildcard's records mixed into
  its answer. See "Architecture: zone storage".
- **Wildcard NODATA is no longer refused (RFC 4035 §5.4, RFC 5155 §8.7)** —
  `proves_nodata` insisted on an NSEC whose owner *is* the queried name, so a
  zone with a wildcard got SERVFAIL for every type the wildcard does not carry:
  when a wildcard answers, nothing sits at the name to hold a type bitmap. It now
  falls back to the other shape — the name shown absent, plus the record at the
  wildcard its closest encloser publishes. The NSEC3 half is RFC 5155 §8.7's
  closest-encloser proof, now shared with the NXDOMAIN path as
  `nsec3_closest_encloser` (§8.3) rather than written twice. `proves_nodata`
  takes the zone name, as `proves_nxdomain` already did. The denial cache is
  untouched by design: it consults only the record *at* a name, so answering from
  a wildcard would be the RFC 8198 §5.3 synthesis it deliberately does not do.
- **Wildcard answers now demand their NSEC (RFC 4035 §5.3.4, RFC 5155 §8.8)** — a
  wildcard's signature verifies at every name the wildcard could expand to, so a
  verified expansion was being served as Secure on the strength of a signature
  that says nothing about the name asked for. `validate_records` now reports each
  expansion and `validate_wildcard_proofs` requires a signed denial of that name,
  including that the wildcard belongs to its closest encloser — without which a
  genuine `*.example.com.` RRset re-owned onto a name under an existing
  `b.example.com.` validates, since `b`'s own NSEC covers it. New
  `dnssec_denial::proves_wildcard_expansion`. Also fixed: the wildcard's *own*
  RRset read as an expansion of itself (the labels field never counts the `*`),
  which would have demanded a proof that the wildcard does not exist. See
  "Architecture: DNSSEC".
- **Aggressive use of validated denials (RFC 8198)** — a validated NSEC/NSEC3 is
  a signed statement about a *range* of names, so `NsecCache` stores the range
  and answers every name in it without asking again. New
  `dnssec_denial::canonical_sort_key` puts canonical name order into bytes so a
  `BTreeMap` can do the covering lookup that `DnsCache`'s `(name, type)` key
  cannot express. Guards: Secure material only, never across an opt-out NSEC3
  span, never below a delegation, wildcard denial required for NXDOMAIN, TTL
  bounded by the proof. See "Architecture: aggressive use".
- **DNSSEC validation on the resolve path** — the chain of trust is walked from
  a trust anchor down to the answer and enforced behind `rdnsr
  --dnssec-validate` (`--trust-anchor <file>` to override the built-in ICANN
  root key). New modules `dnssec_chain` (anchors, states, per-step verdicts) and
  `dnssec_denial` (NSEC/NSEC3, canonical name ordering, type bitmaps,
  base32hex); `dnssec` rewritten around RFC 4035 §5.3.2 signed-data assembly.
  See "Architecture: DNSSEC".
- **The DNSSEC primitives had never run against a real signature, and did not
  work.** Every test fed `b"test"` as the signed data, so nothing exercised the
  crypto. Once real signatures were put through it: the signed-data assembly
  did not exist (no RRSIG prefix, no canonical ordering, no original-TTL
  substitution, no wildcard reconstruction); the DS digest omitted the owner
  name, so no real DS could ever match; ECDSA keys were handed to `ring` without
  the SEC1 `0x04` prefix, so algorithm 13/14 could never verify; the algorithm
  dispatch mapped 8 to ECDSA and 5/7 to RSA/SHA-256 and SHA-512, all wrong
  against IANA; and `construct_rsa_public_key_der` emitted DER with broken
  length encoding and no sign padding (replaced by `ring`'s
  `RsaPublicKeyComponents`, which needs no DER at all).
- **RRSIG expiration and inception were swapped in the codec** — RFC 4034 §3.1
  puts expiration first. Invisible to a round-trip test because both halves
  agreed; against a genuine RRSIG it read an expired signature as current.
- **The root name decoded as `""` rather than `"."`** — every other name gets
  its trailing dot from its last label and the root has none. With 0x20 on, the
  reply check compares the echoed question byte-for-byte, so *every query for
  the root name was rejected as a mismatch*. Only surfaced when the validator
  started asking for `./DNSKEY`, which it does before anything else.
- **NSEC name ordering was string comparison**, not the RFC 4034 §6.1 ordering
  by label from the right, so a range check would accept names outside the gap
  it was given (`a.z.example.com.` vs `b.example.com.` sort opposite ways).
- **IPv6 root hints + `--root-hints` flag** — the built-in hints now ship both
  families (the 13 AAAA addresses too), interleaved v4/v6 so either stack is
  reached in the first hop or two. `query_server` binds a send socket of the
  target's family, which is what actually makes AAAA glue and the v6 hints
  reachable — a v4-wildcard socket cannot connect to a v6 address, so they were
  dead before. `parse_root_hints` reads the published `named.root` format, and
  `rdnsr --root-hints <file>` overrides the built-ins (fails loudly on a file
  with no addresses; ignored when forwarding).
- **RTT-based server selection** — `ask_any` now tries a zone's servers
  fastest-known-first, folding each round trip into a smoothed per-server RTT
  (EWMA, α=0.25) and charging a failure the full timeout, so a slow or dead
  nameserver is demoted after one try instead of being waited on every query.
  Unmeasured servers keep their input order; forwarding reuses the same path.
  `RttStore` shares the delegation cache's capacity bound (0 disables it).
- **0x20 case randomization + reply validation** — outgoing query names get
  their letter case scrambled (draft-vixie-dnsext-dns0x20) and every reply is
  now checked to actually answer the query: matching transaction id, and a
  question that echoes the name sent — case-sensitively when 0x20 is on, which is
  what makes the casing anti-spoof entropy. Neither check existed before; a reply
  from the right address was taken on faith. `zero_x20` flag, default on.
- **QNAME minimization (RFC 9156)** — the walk sends each server only the label
  it is delegating (root learns the TLD, the leaf reaches only the authoritative
  server), probing with QTYPE=NS so a zone cut shows as a referral and a plain
  in-zone name as NODATA. Empty non-terminals cost one extra probe; NXDOMAIN on
  an ancestor short-circuits (RFC 8020). `qname_minimization` config flag,
  default on.
- **Async resolver** — the whole resolve path (`resolve` → `recurse` →
  `resolve_from_root` → `walk` → `ask_any` → `query_server`/TCP fallback) is
  `tokio::net` now, so each round trip is an `await` and `rdnsr` awaits `resolve`
  directly instead of pinning a `spawn_blocking` thread for the sum of the hops.
  Glueless-delegation recursion is boxed (`Box::pin`) to keep the future finite.
- **Delegation cache** — resolution starts at the deepest known zone instead of
  the root every time; stale entries fall back to the root rather than failing.
- **Real recursion, with forwarding as a mode** — root hints, referral walking,
  both bailiwick rules, glueless delegations, CNAME chasing, query budget.
  `RecursiveResolver` (which only ever forwarded) became `Resolver`.
- **`rdnsr` logs why a resolution failed** instead of turning everything into an
  undiagnosable SERVFAIL.
- **Consolidated the wire-writing primitives into `dname`** — one bounds-checked
  write, one label encoder, one statement of the pointer constants, instead of a
  copy on each side of the dname/compression split.
- **Fixed a parser panic on truncated names** — `Label::try_from_bytes` indexed
  unchecked, so a hostile packet panicked the task rather than erroring.
- **Concurrent multi-query TCP in both daemons**, plus `rdnsr`'s TCP listener (it
  had none, so the TC=1 → TCP retry every client makes was refused) and the
  RFC 1035 §4.2.2 framing `rdnsd`'s TCP listener never implemented.
- **Name compression on output (RFC 1035 §4.1.4)** — 170-record A RRset went
  5314 → 2764 bytes (−48%). Owner names always; RDATA names only for
  NS/CNAME/PTR/SOA/MX (RFC 3597 §4 forbids it for newer types); canonical DNSSEC
  output stays uncompressed. Verified against c-ares.
- **TCP fallback on truncation** — a TC=1 UDP answer is re-issued over TCP on the
  same upstream.
- **EDNS0 / OPT (RFC 6891)** — codec, options, the 12-bit extended RCODE,
  BADVERS, payload-size negotiation. Fixed `validate_header` rejecting every
  request with an additional section, which had made `rdnsd`'s EDNS support dead
  on arrival.
- **`DnsMessage::to_bytes` serializes records at all** — responses used to claim
  N answers with an empty body.
- **`rdnsd` answered NXDOMAIN for its own zone** — three independent causes in
  zone matching and zone-file parsing.
- **The `RecordData` raw-storage refactor** — a 24-byte
  `{ rtype: u16, rdata: Box<[u8]> }` holding uncompressed wire bytes, down from a
  ~96-byte three-level enum; the typed view is a flat `ParsedRecord` produced on
  demand, as NSD/Knot/Unbound do it. An earlier plan to *split* the enum was
  abandoned: a Rust enum is sized to its largest variant, so it gave zero
  happy-path benefit.

## Quick reference: the RecordData API

```rust
// stored form (compact, wire-format, uncompressed names)
pub struct RecordData { pub rtype: u16, pub rdata: Box<[u8]> }

RecordData::from_wire(rtype, rdata, &unpacker)? // ingest from the wire
record.parse()?                                 // -> ParsedRecord, on demand
RecordData::from_parsed(&ParsedRecord::A(addr))? // build a record

// TXT is a sequence of byte strings, not a string (RFC 1035 §3.3.14): each is
// length-prefixed on the wire, at most 255 bytes, and the encoder refuses both
// an empty sequence and an over-long string.
ParsedRecord::TXT(vec![b"v=spf1 -all".to_vec()])
record.rtype                                    // type code, direct field read
```

## Quick reference: names on the wire

`dname` owns the primitives — the bounds-checked write, the label encoder, and
the pointer constants. `compression` holds only the per-message offset table and
the policy for which RR types may have compressed names in their RDATA.

```rust
dname_to_bytes("www.example.com.")?     // full, uncompressed — RDATA and DNSSEC

// One compressor per message being serialized; offsets are meaningless across
// messages. DnsMessage::to_bytes drives this for you — you only touch it
// directly if you write a new serializer.
let mut c = NameCompressor::new();
pos = c.write_name("www.example.com.", buf, pos)?;   // literal, or a pointer
pos = c.write_rdata(rtype, &rdata, buf, pos)?;       // NS/CNAME/PTR/SOA/MX only
```

Canonical DNSSEC output must stay uncompressed — use
`serialization::serialize_resource_record_canonical`, not the compressor.

## Quick reference: the EDNS0 API

```rust
// OPT is stored as an ordinary ResourceRecord in `additionals`; `Edns` is an
// interpretation layer over it, NOT a field on DnsMessage.
pub struct Edns { udp_payload_size: u16, version: u8, do_bit: bool,
                  options: Vec<EdnsOption> }
pub struct EdnsOption { code: u16, data: Vec<u8> }

msg.edns()?                       // Option<Edns>; Err = malformed options -> FORMERR
msg.has_edns()                    // infallible; use this to decide OPT mirroring
msg.udp_payload_size()            // OPT CLASS, floored at 512; 512 if no OPT
msg.set_edns(Edns::with_payload_size(4096))?
edns.option(EDNS_OPTION_COOKIE)   // Option<&[u8]>
msg.to_bytes_within(max)?         // truncates + sets TC=1, keeps question + OPT

// msg.rcode holds the FULL 12-bit RCODE. to_bytes splits it across the header's
// low 4 bits and the OPT TTL's top byte; try_from_bytes reassembles it. An RCODE
// above 15 without an OPT record in `additionals` is a to_bytes error.
```

## Quick reference: the DNSSEC API

```rust
// Typed views. Each carries its owner name, because a key or a digest applied
// at the wrong name is the bug these exist to prevent.
Dnskey::from_record(&rr)   // -> Option<Dnskey>;  .key_tag(), .is_zone_key()
Rrsig::from_record(&rr)    // -> Option<Rrsig>;   .is_current(now), .is_wildcard_expansion()
Ds::from_record(&rr)       // -> Option<Ds>;      .matches_key(&dnskey)

// The bytes a signature actually covers (RFC 4035 §5.3.2).
dnssec::signed_data(&rrsig, owner, class, &rdatas)?

// The leaf validator. `zone` is the only zone allowed to have signed this.
let proof = dnssec::verify_rrset(
    &Rrset::new(owner, rtype, class, &rdatas), &rrsigs, &keys, zone, now);
// RrsetProof::{ Verified { wildcard, expires }, Unsigned, Bogus(why), Unsupported(why) }
//   Unsigned  != Bogus: no signature at all is normal, a failed one is not.
//   Unsupported: an algorithm we cannot read -> insecure, never bogus.

// Denial of existence. Names compare by canonical_name_cmp, NOT as strings.
dnssec_denial::nsec3_hash(name, salt, iterations)?   // capped at MAX_NSEC3_ITERATIONS
dnssec_denial::proves_no_ds(zone, &nsecs, &nsec3s)   // -> Denial::{Proved, NotProved(why)}
dnssec_denial::proves_nxdomain(qname, zone, &nsecs, &nsec3s)
// Handles both NODATA shapes: the NSEC at the name, and the wildcard case where
// the name does not exist and the record at `*.encloser` is what applies.
dnssec_denial::proves_nodata(qname, zone, qtype, &nsecs, &nsec3s)
// A wildcard answer's other half: does this name have nothing of its own, and is
// `wildcard` the one its closest encloser publishes? Three states — Opt-Out is
// neither a proof nor an attack.
dnssec_denial::proves_wildcard_expansion(owner, wildcard, &nsecs, &nsec3s)
// -> WildcardVerdict::{ Proved, Unjudgeable(why) /* insecure */, NotProved(why) }

// The chain, one step at a time. Fetching is the resolver's job, not this API's.
let v = ChainValidator::new(&anchors, now);
v.start(name)                                  // -> Option<(anchor zone, its DS)>
v.validate_dnskeys(zone, &records, &ds_set)?   // -> Vec<Dnskey>, or a ValidationState
v.validate_delegation(&evidence, parent, &parent_keys)  // -> DelegationVerdict
v.validate_records(&records, &keystore)        // -> RecordsVerdict
//   .state     -> ValidationState, about the signatures alone
//   .wildcards -> expansions still owing a denial of the name they were served
//                 at. A Secure state with a non-empty list is not yet an answer.
v.validate_wildcard_proofs(&verdict.wildcards, &authority_records, &keystore)

// End to end, from the resolver:
let (answer, state) = resolver.resolve_validated(&query).await?;
// ValidationState::{ Secure, Insecure, Bogus(why), Indeterminate(why) }
//   Secure       -> may set AD
//   Insecure     -> serve it, no AD (provably unsigned: most of the internet)
//   Bogus        -> SERVFAIL, and never cache
//   Indeterminate-> no anchor covers the name; we never looked
```

## Quick reference: the denial cache

```rust
// Zero zones disables it entirely — the same idiom --no-cache uses.
let denials = NsecCache::new(1000);

// Store a denial. ONLY for an answer that validated as Secure: nothing here
// re-checks a signature, so the caller's validation is the whole basis for
// trusting these records later. Needs a SOA in the authority section (it names
// the zone and bounds the negative TTL) or the response is ignored.
denials.insert_validated(&response);

// Answer from a cached gap, or None to go and ask. None is always safe and is
// what comes back whenever anything is in doubt.
if let Some(s) = denials.synthesize(&qname, qtype) {
    // s.rcode     -> NoSuchDomain, or Ok for NODATA
    // s.authority -> SOA + the proof records, TTLs already counted down
    // s.ttl       -> min(proof remaining, SOA negative TTL)
}
```

Deliberately refused, each for a reason worth keeping: QTYPE ANY and RRSIG;
anything below a delegation; NODATA at a delegation for any type but DS;
opt-out NSEC3 spans (rejected at insert); NXDOMAIN without a wildcard denial.
