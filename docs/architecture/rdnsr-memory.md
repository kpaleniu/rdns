## Architecture: what `rdnsr` remembers

Three caches, because there are three shapes of thing to remember and one map
cannot hold them:

| cache | key | holds |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `DnsCache` | (name, type) | the records that answered |
| `NegativeCache` | name, or (name, type) | that there were none (RFC 2308) |
| `NsecCache` | a *range* of names | a signed statement that none of them exist (RFC 8198) |

`NegativeCache` is not redundant with `NsecCache`. The denial cache holds
validated material only — everything it does rests on the proof having been
checked — so it is sized to zero unless `--dnssec-validate` is on, which for most
deployments means negative answers were not cached at all and every repeat of a
failing lookup was a fresh walk to the authoritative server.

The two kinds of "no" are keyed differently because they say different things.
**NXDOMAIN** is about the name: no type at it exists, and nothing below it does
either, since a name with descendants would be an empty non-terminal answering
NODATA (RFC 8020 — the resolver's walk already stops on an ancestor's NXDOMAIN,
and a cache that disagreed with the walk would be the odd one out). The lookup is
therefore a walk up the ancestors, bounded by the label count. **NODATA** is about
one type at a name that does exist, so it is keyed by both and says nothing about
any other type.

Three rules keep it honest. **An SOA is required** — RFC 2308 §5 takes the
negative TTL from it, so a "no" that arrives without one never said how long it
was good for; this is also what keeps a referral out of the cache. **The TTL is
`min(SOA MINIMUM, the SOA record's TTL)`, capped at an hour**, and the records
handed back count down, so a client cannot re-cache a "no" for longer than we may
hold it. **Nothing bogus is stored**, and whether an answer validated is stored
with it, so the AD bit the second client sees is the one the first client saw.

Lookup order in `handle_query` is denials → negatives → answers → resolve. The
denial cache goes first because it answers questions never asked, and is skipped
for a client with CD set for the same reason. The negative cache is not skipped:
it returns the answer *this* question actually got, which is caching rather than
filtering.

`rdnsd` had to change for any of this to work: a negative answer now carries the
zone's SOA in the authority section (RFC 2308 §2.1, §2.2). Without it a
downstream resolver — ours included — has no negative TTL and cannot cache the
answer at all.
