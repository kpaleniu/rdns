## Architecture: names that never leave (RFC 6761, 6762, 6303)

Some names are reserved for uses that are not the global DNS, and treating them as
ordinary questions does three things wrong at once: it answers slowly (a full walk
to the root, then a failure), it answers wrongly (whatever a wildcard-happy TLD or
a captive portal decides to say), and it *tells the root servers* what those names
are. The reverse lookups leak most: every query for `10.in-addr.arpa` describes a
piece of somebody's internal addressing to a public server, and AS112 exists purely
to absorb the flood of them.

`special_names::lookup` is a table consulted **first** — before every cache, before
any resolution. For these names the table *is* the answer, so consulting anything
else would already mean a query going out.

- **`localhost` and everything under it** is the loopback address (RFC 6761 §6.3).
  The subtree matters: `api.dev.localhost` is as much this machine as `localhost`
  is, and software relies on it. Types other than A and AAAA get NODATA, not
  NXDOMAIN — the name exists, and saying otherwise would be a lie about the one
  name every machine has.
- **`.local` is mDNS** (RFC 6762 §3), so NXDOMAIN is the literal truth rather than
  a policy: the name really does not exist in the DNS.
- **`invalid.`** is reserved to be unresolvable (§6.4).
- **The loopback reverse zones** (RFC 6303 §4.2, §4.3): `127.in-addr.arpa` with
  `1.0.0.127` answering `localhost.`, and the `::1` reverse.
- **The empty zones** (RFC 6303 §4), the private-address reverse zones,
  including the sixteen separate zones that 172.16/12 actually is —
  `in-addr.arpa` splits on octet boundaries and that block does not.

The last group is the only one an operator may switch off, singly or all at
once: RFC 6303 §3 says an implementation MUST allow it, because a site with its
own `10.in-addr.arpa` has to be able to reach it. The others are protocol
requirements and are fixed. The two are separate tables so that difference is
in the code rather than in a comment (`TODO.md` #173).

Every answer here carries **AA=1**, which RFC 6303 §3 asks for and every
resolved answer lacks: these zones are defined to be empty, so the subtree
claim RFC 8020 reads into AA is the intended one.

**Not in the table, deliberately:** RFC 6761 also reserves `example.`,
`example.com.`, `.net` and `.org` — as *ordinary* names, delegated and resolvable.
Special-casing them would break the only thing they exist for, which is being
copied out of documentation and working.

Two properties worth stating. **Never AD**, because nothing here was validated — it
was decided by specification, and claiming otherwise is the one lie a validating
client cannot check for itself. And **not skipped for a client with CD**: CD says
"do not withhold an answer because it failed validation", which is about DNSSEC, not
a request to hear what a public server thinks `localhost` is.

Each negative answer carries a **synthetic SOA** so a downstream resolver can cache
it (RFC 2308 §5 takes the negative TTL from it). It has to be invented — these
zones exist by specification rather than by delegation — and follows what Unbound
synthesizes for a `local-zone`, with `nobody.invalid.` as the responsible mailbox:
unmistakably synthetic, and guaranteed by §6.4 not to resolve.

**Verified live** by forwarding to `192.0.2.1` (TEST-NET-1, which cannot answer):
every special name was answered anyway, none with AD, while `example.com` and
`1.1.1.1.in-addr.arpa` went to the network — visible in their 0x20 case-randomized
echo, which only comes back from a real server.
