## Architecture: why `rdnsr` is separate from `rdnsd`

Split following the NSD/Unbound and Knot/Knot-Resolver precedent: opposite trust
models (serving the public versus serving your clients), different data (zones
versus a cache), independent lifecycle, and no risk of an accidental open
resolver. Forwarding versus recursion divides none of those, which is why *that*
is a mode rather than a fifth crate.

`rdnsr` (`rdnsr/src/answer.rs`): query → EDNS sanity check (FORMERR / BADVERS) →
`DnsCache` lookup → miss resolves by awaiting `Resolver::resolve` (async; each
upstream round trip is an `await`, no blocking thread) →
cache-store by (name,type)+TTL → reply, echoing the client's txn id with RA set
and OPT mirrored only if the client used EDNS. Cache hits return in 0 ms against
~7 ms for a miss.

It serves UDP *and* TCP on one host:port — both loops are spawned and whichever
fails first takes the process down, so it never silently serves one transport.
Its UDP loop still spawns a task per datagram, unlike `rdnsd`'s, and is bounded
by `--max-inflight-udp` (default 1024) rather than replaced by a worker pool:
see [one process per server](one-process-per-server.md) for why seconds of recursion want the
opposite shape from microseconds of zone lookup.
TCP is not optional for a resolver: when an answer overflows the client's
advertised UDP payload we reply TC=1, and RFC 1035 §4.2.1 has the client retry
over TCP. The transport reaches `handle_query` as a `Transport` enum whose only
job is picking the response size limit.

~~Two things `rdnsr` does *not* share with `rdnsd`: it doesn't run the
`RequestValidator`, and it has no zone storage.~~ **One thing** (2026-10-07, `TODO.md` #184): it has
no zone storage. It runs the same admission as `rdnsd` — `AdmissionCheck`,
which `RequestValidator` became — and parses through `validation::Request`,
since `docs/spec/07` G-2. `--no-cache` is a zero-capacity
`DnsCache` (`put` is a no-op at 0) rather than an `Option`. `--dnssec-validate`
turns on the chain walk described under [DNSSEC](dnssec.md); the cache
remembers each entry's validation state alongside it, so an answer served from
cache carries the same AD bit the first client saw and no other.
