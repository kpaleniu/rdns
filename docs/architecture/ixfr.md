## Architecture: incremental transfer (RFC 1995)

An AXFR moves the whole zone whenever any part of it moves: a serial bump and one
changed address cost a fresh copy. That is what makes a secondary with a short
REFRESH expensive to be, and what IXFR exists to fix.

**Where the deltas come from was the decision.** BIND keeps an on-disk journal,
which is what you need when the zone is edited in place by dynamic UPDATE —
there, the journal *is* the record of what happened. Here a zone comes from a file
and changes in discrete events (a reload, or a transfer from a master), so the
difference between two versions can be computed when the new one arrives and kept
in memory. ~~That is `ixfr-from-differences` without the journal, and the same call
NSD made. A journal earns its keep at #7 step 6 and not before.~~ **The journal
came with dynamic UPDATE on 2026-08-03 (#10)**, and with zones from a directory
every delta is written to it, a reload's and a transfer's as well as an
UPDATE's (`rdnsd/src/zones.rs`, `journal.save`) (2026-10-07, `TODO.md` #184).

~~**The consequence, stated so nobody is surprised:** a restart forgets the deltas.
Every secondary asking for an increment across one gets a full transfer instead,
which RFC 1995 §4 permits unconditionally and which corrects itself at the next
change.~~ **Journalled since 2026-08-03** (2026-10-07, `TODO.md` #184): each step is written beside the
zone and `restore_journals` reads it back at startup, so a restart keeps the
history (`docs/spec/03`, the journal paragraph). `DeltaLog` also keeps only `MAX_DELTAS_PER_ZONE` (32) steps per zone; a
client further behind than that gets the zone.

**The response is positional, and that is the part to get right.** Not "the
changed records": the current SOA, then one *difference sequence* per version step
— old SOA, deletions, new SOA, additions — then the current SOA again. A client
reads the second record of the stream to decide what it is holding; another SOA
means an increment, anything else means the server fell back to the whole zone.
Four things make it fall back, each logged: no SOA in the request, no unbroken
chain back to the client's serial, a chain that does not reach the serial we are
serving, or an increment no smaller than the zone (§4 says to send the zone then,
since the point is that less crosses the wire).

**A gap in the chain is not something to paper over.** If the steps from the
client's serial do not link end to end up to the current one, applying the rest
would leave the client holding a zone that never existed — with a serial saying it
is current, which no comparison afterwards could catch. `chain_from` returns
nothing rather than a partial chain, and the answer is a full transfer.

Three details worth not re-deriving:

- **The apex SOA is excluded from the deltas.** It is carried by the framing, as
  the header of each half; a copy among the records would read as the start of
  another difference sequence.
- **A TTL change is a deletion and an addition.** A secondary caches and re-serves
  that number, so two records differing only in TTL are not the same record to it.
  This is what BIND produces too.
- **The diff counts rather than sets.** A zone holding the same record twice does
  not read as a change when one copy is removed.

**The delta log is derived state, so it moves with the zone map or not at all.**
Every replacement goes through `install_zone`/`install_all_zones`, which take both
locks and record the step in the same call — the same hazard the zone index has,
and the reason `note_change` wants both versions rather than being something a
caller can forget. A zone that is withdrawn (expired, or gone from the
configuration) has its history dropped: offering increments of a zone we no longer
serve would be answering for something we stopped serving. Under `answer_transfer`
the log is read *under the zone lock*, so the increments and the zone they are
increments of are the same version.

**Gated by the same ACL as an AXFR**, because an IXFR may answer with the whole
zone — a policy that let it through would be no policy at all.

**Over UDP, the answer is always a single SOA of the current version**, which is
RFC 1995 §2's own "come back over TCP" signal. Deliberate rather than a
limitation: the ACL, the TSIG session and the multi-message packing all live on
the TCP path, and duplicating them to serve the increments that happen to fit a
datagram would be a second implementation of the interesting parts.

### The client half

A refresh asks for the difference whenever it has a version to differ from, and
for the whole zone when it does not. That is a *preference*, not a demand — which
is why there is one code path and not two.

**The answer's shape is positional, and a client cannot assume it got what it
asked for.** The signal is the second record of the stream: another SOA means
difference sequences follow, anything else means the server chose to send the
whole zone. A client that assumed sequences would read a zone's first ordinary
record as the header of a delete section and start deleting things. `IxfrAssembler`
therefore switches to `AxfrAssembler` at that point rather than growing a second
copy of the rules about what a transfer may contain — bailiwick, the closing SOA,
the bound — which apply identically either way.

Two boundaries in that state machine are worth not re-deriving. An SOA arriving
during a sequence's *additions* is either the next sequence's header or the
closing record, and the serial is what tells them apart: the next sequence starts
where this one ended, which equals the current serial only when there is nothing
left to send. And an "already current" answer is a single SOA with no terminator
of its own, so it is recognised by being the whole of the first message — a server
with sequences to send packs them into that same message rather than sending one
record and pausing.

**Applying is rebuild, not edit** (`ixfr::apply_changes`), which is the
simplification noted under #7 and the reason `Zone` has no record-removal API and
should never get one: the index holds *positions* into the record vector, so
removing in place invalidates every later one. Rebuilding is O(zone size) per
sequence rather than per record, and the result is a zone built by the ordinary
constructor whose index cannot disagree with its contents.

**A deletion for a record we do not hold is counted, not fatal.** It means our
copy and the master's had already diverged — worth logging, never worth refusing
the transfer over, since the record is meant to be gone either way and failing
would strand the secondary on a version it can never leave.

One consequence worth knowing: an increment and a full transfer produce the same
zone but not the same *file*, because a changed record is deleted and re-added and
so moves to the end of the load order. Confirmed identical as record sets, which
is what a zone is; a textual diff between two secondaries that took different
routes to the same serial is expected.

**Verified live, both directions.** Outbound, against dnspython — our client and
our server agreeing about a format proves nothing. A secondary holding one
recorded change was asked for an increment by `dns.query.inbound_xfr` from serial
200; dnspython applied it and arrived at serial 201 with exactly the right nine
records. The other two paths too: asking from the current serial changed nothing
(one SOA), and asking from a serial we never held replaced the client's zone
wholesale and dropped a record that only existed there.

Inbound, as a three-node tree — primary → S1 → S2, which is also the check that
this composes. The primary was restarted with a changed zone, so it had no deltas
and sent S1 the whole zone (`sent in full`, exactly as documented). S1 recorded the
step, and S2's next refresh took it as `1 incremental step(s)`: 8 records on the
wire against the 12 a full transfer moved, with the changed address updated, the
new record present, the deleted one answering NXDOMAIN, and the untouched records
untouched. S1's and S2's zones compared identical as record sets.
