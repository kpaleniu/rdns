## Architecture: following a trust anchor (RFC 5011)

A trust anchor is a key you decided to believe out of band, so every change to one
is an out-of-band event: a rebuild, or an operator editing a file. That holds until
the key rolls — and the root KSK does roll, at which point every validator that
has not been updated fails closed on the entire internet. RFC 5011 makes the roll
followable, using the zone's own signed DNSKEY RRset as the announcement channel.

`--auto-trust-anchor <file>` turns it on. The difference from `--trust-anchor` is
who owns the file: that one is read and never written, this one is read *and*
rewritten as keys move.

**Two rules carry the whole security argument.**

- **A new key is trusted because it stayed, not because it appeared.** Thirty days
  of continuous publication (`ADD_HOLD_DOWN`) before adoption. The point is the
  time: an attacker who has the zone's keys must keep the compromise up, and
  visible, for a month before any validator adopts a key of theirs.
- **A key is revoked only by itself.** REVOKE counts only when the RRset carrying
  it is signed *by that key* (§2.1). Without that, whoever holds any one of a
  zone's keys could retire the others. `self_signers` verifies each candidate
  *alone* against the RRSIGs, so "someone signed this" can never be mistaken for
  "this key signed this".

**Everything rests on the input having been validated**, and `observe` cannot check
that for itself — it is handed a DNSKEY RRset and reasons about it over time.
`probe_zone` therefore insists on `Secure` and nothing else: an Insecure or
Indeterminate answer for a zone we anchor is not an unsigned zone, it is an answer
that could not be tied to the anchor. Same posture as `NsecCache::insert_validated`,
and the same warning in the docs.

Four things that are easy to get wrong, three of which were:

- **Identity is (algorithm, protocol, public key), not the record.** Revoking sets
  a flag and therefore changes the key tag (§2.1 says so explicitly). Identifying
  keys by tag or RDATA makes a revocation look like an unrelated new key — and
  starts a hold-down on the key being retired.
- **The hold-down must not restart when the key is observed again**, or it never
  elapses and the key is never adopted. A failure that would surface 30 days after
  a roll, in production. There is a test that probes daily for a month.
- **A revocation outranks a configured DS.** The operator wrote "trust this
  digest"; the key has since said, with its own signature, to stop. Leaving the DS
  in place would mean a static anchor can never be retired by the mechanism built
  to retire it — and the built-in ICANN anchor is exactly such a DS. So a tracked
  key is kept in its *unrevoked* form (a DS digest covers the flags, so only that
  form matches) and the revocation lives in the state.
- **Only secure entry points are tracked.** The literal reading of §4 tracks every
  key in the RRset; against the real root that means tracking the ZSK, which nobody
  will ever publish a DS for. The root replaces its ZSK quarterly by dropping it,
  never by revoking it, and a key that merely disappears stays trusted by design —
  so the literal reading gains a permanently trusted stale key every three months.
  SEP is formally a hint, so this narrowing would miss a zone that rolled to a KSK
  without it; that is an unusual mistake with `--trust-anchor` as the way out,
  whereas unbounded growth of the trusted set is invisible.

**A key that merely vanishes stays trusted** (`Missing`). Deliberate: a key
disappearing is far likelier to be a zone publishing badly than an operator
retiring one, and retiring has a mechanism. **And with no anchor for a zone,
nothing is learned about it** (§5) — a resolver that bootstrapped itself there
would be trusting whatever answered.

**Persistence** is the writable trust-anchor file the persistence table called for,
in Unbound's spirit: DS and DNSKEY lines in presentation format, with `;;state=`
and `;;since=` annotations carrying the bookkeeping. A DNSKEY line *without*
annotations is read as a key the operator has decided to trust outright, because
making them write bookkeeping fields by hand to be believed would be a trap. The
file is written at startup if absent, so pointing at a new path shows immediately
what is trusted rather than after the first change. Unlike the transfer sidecar, a
corrupt file here is **fatal**: forgetting a serial costs a refresh, forgetting
anchor state costs either the internet or a hold-down that had nearly elapsed.

The live anchor set is behind `SharedAnchors` (a `std::sync::RwLock`, cloned per
validated resolve so no guard is ever held across an await), because the point is
to follow a roll without a restart. The set is replaced only *after* the file is
written: validating against keys we could not record would forget them on restart,
which is what the file exists to prevent.

**Verified against the real root zone**, which was not expected to be possible
here — port 53 is intercepted (see "Verifying") and recursion generally fails, but
a one-hop `./DNSKEY` query does get answered. So the probe ran for real: key 20326
was adopted immediately as the built-in DS's match, and the two other published
keys entered hold-down. That run is what found the ZSK-tracking flaw above — no
unit test would have, because the flaw is in what the real root publishes. The
state machine's timing, and the revocation rule against genuine signatures
(`dnssec_test_util` keys that really sign), are covered by tests.
