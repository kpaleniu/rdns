# Quick reference

The API cheat sheets, moved out of `TODO.md` on 2026-10-04 with the
architecture notes beside them in this directory.

## Quick reference: the RecordData API

```rust
// stored form (compact, wire-format, uncompressed names)
pub struct RecordData { pub rtype: u16, pub rdata: Box<[u8]> }

RecordData::from_wire(rtype, rdata, &unpacker)? // ingest from the wire
record.parse()?                                 // -> ParsedRecord, on demand
RecordData::from_parsed(&ParsedRecord::A(addr))? // build a record

// TXT is a sequence of byte strings, not a string (RFC 1035 §3.3.14): each is
// length-prefixed on the wire, at most 255 bytes, and the encoder refuses both
// an empty sequence and an over-long string.
ParsedRecord::TXT(vec![b"v=spf1 -all".to_vec()])
record.rtype                                    // type code, direct field read
```

## Quick reference: names on the wire

`name` owns the type and both text doors; `dname` is the wire *reader* — the
label walk, the pointer resolution and the length limits — and nothing else since
#36. `compression` holds only the per-message offset table and the policy for
which RR types may have compressed names in their RDATA.

```rust
let name: Name = "www.example.com.".parse()?;   // presentation text in
name.as_ref().as_wire()                         // uncompressed octets out
Name::from_wire_in(bytes, &unpacker)?           // off a message, pointers followed

// One compressor per message being serialized; offsets are meaningless across
// messages. DnsMessage::to_bytes drives this for you — you only touch it
// directly if you write a new serializer.
let mut c = NameCompressor::new();
pos = c.write_name(name.as_ref(), buf, pos)?;        // literal, or a pointer
pos = c.write_rdata(rtype, &rdata, buf, pos)?;       // NS/CNAME/PTR/SOA/MX only
```

Canonical DNSSEC output must stay uncompressed — use `dnssec::signed_data`, which
is the live canonicalization and the one the validator agrees with. (This used to
point at `serialization::serialize_resource_record_canonical`, which was deleted
in #9e: it never sorted and never down-cased, so it produced neither RFC 4034
§6.2 canonical form nor the ordering its own doc comment promised.)

## Quick reference: the EDNS0 API

```rust
// OPT is stored as an ordinary ResourceRecord in `additionals`; `Edns` is an
// interpretation layer over it, NOT a field on DnsMessage.
pub struct Edns { udp_payload_size: u16, version: u8, do_bit: bool,
                  options: Vec<EdnsOption> }
pub struct EdnsOption { code: u16, data: Vec<u8> }

msg.edns()?                       // Option<Edns>; Err = malformed options -> FORMERR
msg.has_edns()                    // infallible; use this to decide OPT mirroring
msg.udp_payload_size()            // OPT CLASS, floored at 512; 512 if no OPT
msg.set_edns(Edns::with_payload_size(4096))?
edns.option(EDNS_OPTION_COOKIE)   // Option<&[u8]>
msg.to_bytes_within(max)?         // truncates + sets TC=1, keeps question + OPT

// msg.rcode holds the FULL 12-bit RCODE. to_bytes splits it across the header's
// low 4 bits and the OPT TTL's top byte; try_from_bytes reassembles it. An RCODE
// above 15 without an OPT record in `additionals` is a to_bytes error.
```

## Quick reference: the DNSSEC API

```rust
// Typed views. Each carries its owner name, because a key or a digest applied
// at the wrong name is the bug these exist to prevent.
Dnskey::from_record(&rr)   // -> Option<Dnskey>;  .key_tag(), .is_zone_key()
Rrsig::from_record(&rr)    // -> Option<Rrsig>;   .is_current(now), .is_wildcard_expansion()
Ds::from_record(&rr)       // -> Option<Ds>;      .matches_key(&dnskey)

// The bytes a signature actually covers (RFC 4035 §5.3.2).
dnssec::signed_data(&rrsig, owner, class, &rdatas)?

// The leaf validator. `zone` is the only zone allowed to have signed this.
let proof = dnssec::verify_rrset(
    &Rrset::new(owner, rtype, class, &rdatas), &rrsigs, &keys, zone, now);
// RrsetProof::{ Verified { wildcard, expires }, Unsigned, Bogus(why), Unsupported(why) }
//   Unsigned  != Bogus: no signature at all is normal, a failed one is not.
//   Unsupported: an algorithm we cannot read -> insecure, never bogus.

// Denial of existence. Names compare by canonical_name_cmp, NOT as strings.
dnssec_denial::nsec3_hash(name, salt, iterations)?   // capped at MAX_NSEC3_ITERATIONS
dnssec_denial::proves_no_ds(zone, &nsecs, &nsec3s)   // -> Denial::{Proved, NotProved(why)}
dnssec_denial::proves_nxdomain(qname, zone, &nsecs, &nsec3s)
// Handles both NODATA shapes: the NSEC at the name, and the wildcard case where
// the name does not exist and the record at `*.encloser` is what applies.
dnssec_denial::proves_nodata(qname, zone, qtype, &nsecs, &nsec3s)
// A wildcard answer's other half: does this name have nothing of its own, and is
// `wildcard` the one its closest encloser publishes? Three states — Opt-Out is
// neither a proof nor an attack.
dnssec_denial::proves_wildcard_expansion(owner, wildcard, &nsecs, &nsec3s)
// -> WildcardVerdict::{ Proved, Unjudgeable(why) /* insecure */, NotProved(why) }

// The chain, one step at a time. Fetching is the resolver's job, not this API's.
// pub(crate) since #151b: the resolver is the one driver, so outside `rdns`
// this is reached through `resolve_validated` below.
let v = ChainValidator::new(&anchors, now);
v.start(name)                                  // -> Option<(anchor zone, its DS)>
v.validate_dnskeys(zone, &records, &ds_set)?   // -> Vec<Dnskey>, or a ValidationState
v.validate_delegation(&evidence, parent, &parent_keys)  // -> DelegationVerdict
v.validate_records(&records, &keystore)        // -> RecordsVerdict
//   .state     -> ValidationState, about the signatures alone
//   .wildcards -> expansions still owing a denial of the name they were served
//                 at. A Secure state with a non-empty list is not yet an answer.
v.validate_wildcard_proofs(&verdict.wildcards, &authority_records, &keystore)

// End to end, from the resolver:
let (answer, state) = resolver.resolve_validated(&query).await?;
// ValidationState::{ Secure, Insecure, Bogus(why), Indeterminate(why) }
//   Secure       -> may set AD
//   Insecure     -> serve it, no AD (provably unsigned: most of the internet)
//   Bogus        -> SERVFAIL, and never cache
//   Indeterminate-> no anchor covers the name; we never looked
```

## Quick reference: signing a zone

```rust
// Keys. The owner name and flags are part of the key, not of the call.
let ksk = SigningKey::generate(SigningAlgorithm::EcdsaP256Sha256,
                               "example.com.", DNSKEY_FLAG_ZONE | DNSKEY_FLAG_SEP)?;
ksk.write_to_dir(Path::new("/etc/rdns/keys"))?;   // K<zone>+<alg>+<tag>.rdnskey
let keys = SigningKey::load_dir(Path::new("/etc/rdns/keys"))?;  // a bad file is an error
ksk.ds(2)?          // what the parent has to publish; 2 is SHA-256
ksk.dnskey()        // what the zone publishes
SigningKey::from_pkcs8(alg, owner, flags, &pkcs8)?  // an openssl key, imported

// Signing. The input zone is untouched; the result is a new one.
let policy = SigningPolicy::valid_for(now, 30 * 86_400)   // inception backdated an hour
    .with_chain(DenialChain::nsec3());                    // or DenialChain::Nsec
let signed = zone_signer::sign_zone(&zone, &keys, &policy)?;
// Idempotent where it matters: the previous run's RRSIG/NSEC/NSEC3/NSEC3PARAM are
// dropped first. DNSKEYs are NOT — a pre-published key is how a rollover starts.

// Serving. One zone's answer to one question, with every DNSSEC record it
// owes when DO is set and the zone is signed (#150); the proof table is
// private to it.
zone_answer::write(&zone, &qname, qtype, dnssec_ok, &mut response_writer)?;

// The zone's own ordered chains, for finding a covering record without scanning.
zone.nsec_covering(name)      // greatest entry strictly below, wrapping
zone.nsec3_covering(&hash)
zone.holds_name(name)         // exact — NOT name_exists, which honours wildcards
```

## Quick reference: answer shape

```rust
// Is this answer the CNAME chain the question asked for? Independent of the
// signatures — each RRset verifying says nothing about the collection.
// pub(crate) since #151b, with the rest of the resolver-only chain API.
match dnssec_chain::cname_chain_shape(&qname, qtype, &answers) {
    ChainShape::Intact { final_name } => {}
    ChainShape::Broken(why) => {}   // -> Bogus
}
```

## Quick reference: the denial cache

```rust
// Zero zones disables it entirely — the same idiom --no-cache uses.
let denials = NsecCache::new(1000);

// Store a denial. ONLY for an answer that validated as Secure: nothing here
// re-checks a signature, so the caller's validation is the whole basis for
// trusting these records later. Needs a SOA in the authority section (it names
// the zone and bounds the negative TTL) or the response is ignored.
denials.insert_validated(&response);

// Answer from a cached gap, or None to go and ask. None is always safe and is
// what comes back whenever anything is in doubt.
if let Some(s) = denials.synthesize(&qname, qtype) {
    // s.rcode     -> NoSuchDomain, or Ok for NODATA
    // s.authority -> SOA + the proof records, TTLs already counted down
    // s.ttl       -> min(proof remaining, SOA negative TTL)
}
```

```rust
// The positive half (RFC 8198 §5.3). Same precondition: Secure answers only.
denials.insert_validated_wildcard(&response);

if let Some(w) = denials.synthesize_wildcard(&qname, qtype) {
    // w.answers   -> the wildcard's records, re-owned onto qname, TTL counted down
    // w.authority -> the NSEC proving qname absent, so a client can check it
}
```

Deliberately refused, each for a reason worth keeping: QTYPE ANY and RRSIG;
anything below a delegation; NODATA at a delegation for any type but DS;
opt-out NSEC3 spans (rejected at insert); NXDOMAIN without a wildcard denial; and
a wildcard answering for a name deeper than the one label it reaches.

## Quick reference: managed trust anchors

```rust
// Load, or seed from whatever anchors are configured. Fatal on a corrupt file:
// forgetting anchor state is not like forgetting a zone serial.
let mut managed = ManagedAnchors::load_or_seed(path, &configured, now)?;

// Feed it a DNSKEY RRset that VALIDATED — this checks no signatures itself, and
// unvalidated input here hands over the trust anchor set. `self_signers` is the
// subset that signed the RRset, which is the only basis for a revocation.
let signers = rfc5011::self_signers(zone, &response.answers, now);
for change in managed.observe(zone, &keys, &signers, now) { /* log it */ }

managed.save(path)?;                     // write before trusting, always
anchors.replace(managed.trust_anchors()); // SharedAnchors: live, no restart

// When to ask again (RFC 5011 §2.3), bounded at both ends.
rfc5011::query_interval(original_ttl, signature_remaining);
rfc5011::retry_interval(original_ttl, signature_remaining);
```

The order matters: the file is written *before* the live set is replaced, because
validating against keys we could not record would forget them on restart — which
is the failure the file exists to prevent.

## Quick reference: replication

```rust
// The client half of a transfer. All three open a TCP connection and time out.
xfr::fetch_soa(master, "example.com.", key.as_ref()).await?;   // -> u32 serial
xfr::fetch_zone(master, "example.com.", key.as_ref()).await?;  // -> Zone

// Incremental. The master may answer with the whole zone whatever you ask, so
// all three outcomes have to be handled — this is a preference, not a demand.
match xfr::fetch_changes(master, &held, key.as_ref()).await? {
    xfr::IxfrOutcome::UpToDate(serial) => {}
    xfr::IxfrOutcome::Updated { zone, steps, missing_deletions } => {}
    xfr::IxfrOutcome::FullTransfer(zone) => {}
}

// Or drive the assembling yourself, message by message, with no socket.
let mut assembler = xfr::AxfrAssembler::new("example.com.");
if assembler.accept(&msg)? == xfr::Progress::Complete {
    let zone = assembler.into_zone()?;   // errors if the closing SOA never came
}
// The incremental one is the same shape, and `into_outcome` takes the version
// the request was made from — applying to anything else builds a zone that
// never existed.
let mut assembler = xfr::IxfrAssembler::new("example.com.");
if assembler.accept(&msg)? == xfr::Progress::Complete {
    let outcome = assembler.into_outcome(&held)?;
}

// Policy: when to ask, when to give up, what to remember.
secondary::MasterSpec::parse("example.com@192.0.2.1:53#transfer.key.")?;
let timers = secondary::RefreshTimers::from_zone(&zone).unwrap_or_default();
timers.after_success();  timers.after_failure();
timers.has_expired(last_contact, now);          // -> stop serving the zone
remote_serial.is_newer_than(ours);              // RFC 1982; `>` will not compile

let mut state = secondary::StateFile::load(&secondary::state_file_path(dir));
state.get("example.com.", master);              // Option<&TransferState>
state.record(TransferState { .. })?;            // upsert + atomic rewrite

// Outbound increments. The log is derived from the zone map: record the step in
// the same breath as the swap, or an IXFR describes a zone we do not serve.
let mut deltas = ixfr::DeltaLog::new();
deltas.note_change(previous_version, &new_version);
deltas.forget("example.com.");                  // a zone we stopped serving
ixfr::apply_changes(&base, &deleted, &added, &new_soa);  // -> (Zone, removed)
match ixfr::ixfr_response(&request, &zone, &deltas)? {
    ixfr::IxfrResponse::UpToDate(messages) => {}          // one SOA
    ixfr::IxfrResponse::Incremental { messages, .. } => {}
    ixfr::IxfrResponse::FullTransfer { messages, why } => {}  // always allowed
}
```

Nothing here trusts what arrives: a transfer must open and close with the apex
SOA, every record must be in bailiwick, and a delta chain with a gap is refused
rather than partially applied. When adding to this, keep that posture — the
failures it prevents are all invisible after the fact.

## Quick reference: writing a zone, and writing a file

```rust
// Serialize a zone. Fails only on something this format cannot express — in
// practice an owner name needing escapes the parser does not read back.
let text: String = zone_writer::zone_to_string(&zone)?;
zone_writer::write_zone_file(&zone, Path::new("/var/db/example.com.zone"))?;
zone_writer::record_to_string(&record)?;   // one line, for logs and diffs

// Replace a file atomically: temporary sibling -> fsync -> rename. Use this for
// every piece of persisted state, not just zones (the step-3 sidecar included).
persist::write_atomically(path, bytes)?;
persist::write_atomically_str(path, &text)?;
```

What comes back out is byte-identical to what went in, including for records this
library cannot parse — that is the property to preserve when touching either
module, because a signed RRset re-spelled differently is a bogus one. Do not add
a "prettier" rendering without re-checking it against the re-encode guard in
`rdata_to_string`.
