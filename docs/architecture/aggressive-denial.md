## Architecture: aggressive use of validated denials (RFC 8198)

An NSEC record does not say "this name does not exist". It says "nothing exists
between these two names", and it is signed. A validator holding one therefore
already knows the answer for *every* name in that gap, and asking the
authoritative server again learns nothing it was not already told. `NsecCache`
caches the gap rather than the question, which turns a flood of random names
under one zone — a water-torture attack, or an ordinary typo storm — from one
upstream query per name into one query per zone.

This could not be bolted onto `DnsCache`. That maps `(name, type)` to records
and can only answer the question it was asked; a gap has to be searched by
*range*. So the proofs live in a `BTreeMap` ordered by
`dnssec_denial::canonical_sort_key` — a byte encoding of the labels right to
left, each terminated by a zero byte, whose plain `Ord` is exactly RFC 4034
§6.1 canonical order. A covering lookup is then `range(..=key).next_back()`,
falling back to the last entry for the record that wraps to the apex.

Everything here is a way of *not* asking, so every mistake is invisible until it
denies a name that exists. Five rules keep that from happening:

- **Only Secure material is stored.** `rdnsr` inserts a denial only when
  validation returned Secure. An unvalidated NSEC is an attacker's assertion
  about which names do not exist, which is a denial-of-service primitive.
- **Never across an opt-out NSEC3 span** (RFC 8198 §5.2). Opt-out means the span
  may contain delegations the zone never named. Refused at *insert* rather than
  at lookup, so no code path can consult one.
- **Never below a delegation.** This one is not in the RFC's list and is the
  easiest to get wrong. A gap says nothing exists *in this zone* between its
  endpoints; if its lower edge is a delegation (NS set, SOA clear), everything
  under that name lives in the child zone — and those names sort *inside* the
  gap, because `sub.example.com.` and `x.sub.example.com.` are canonically
  adjacent. Synthesizing there denies an entire zone we were never authoritative
  for. `ZoneProofs::covering_nsec` refuses it, and a test pins the ordering fact
  that makes it possible.
- **NXDOMAIN needs the wildcard denied too**, or a name the gap covers could
  still have been answered by a wildcard higher up. Rather than re-derive that
  argument, the cache gathers the candidate records and hands them to the same
  `dnssec_denial::proves_nxdomain` that validated them — a second implementation
  would drift from the first.
- **TTL is bounded by the proof**, not by the question: the minimum of the
  proof records' remaining life and the SOA's negative TTL (RFC 2308 §5),
  applied in one place to every record going out, so a client cannot re-cache a
  proof for longer than we may hold it.

At a delegation point the parent holds only the DS, so a NODATA there is
synthesized for QTYPE=DS and refused for anything else — the real answer to
those is a referral. ANY and RRSIG are never synthesized: neither can be
reasoned about from a type bitmap.

**The positive half, §5.3.** A validated *wildcard* answer is the same kind of
statement as a validated NSEC — one signature covering a whole set of names — so
it is kept too, under the wildcard rather than under the name that happened to be
asked for. Another name the wildcard reaches is then answered without asking,
with the records re-owned onto it and the wildcard's own signature attached: that
signature verifies at the new name unchanged, which is exactly what makes this
legal and also why a wildcard answer needs its own denial in the first place.

Two rules, and the second is where this would go wrong:

- **The name must be proved absent**, by a cached covering NSEC. An existing name
  shadows the wildcard entirely (RFC 1034 §4.3.3), so without that proof there is
  no basis to answer at all — and the same delegation rule applies as on the
  negative side, for the same reason.
- **The wildcard must be the one that governs the name**: `*.` plus its *immediate
  parent*, and nothing shallower. A wildcard reaches exactly one label (RFC 4592
  §2.1.1), and "some cached NSEC covers the name" cannot tell `a.example.com.`
  from `a.b.example.com.`, because a name sorts before everything beneath it. The
  wildcard is therefore *derived* from the queried name rather than searched for
  among the ones we hold, which makes the mistake unavailable.

  **The citation here is wrong — see #9a.** RFC 4592 §2.1.1 is about zone-file
  syntax, not synthesis depth; the source of synthesis is the wildcard immediately
  below the *closest encloser*, which can be several labels above the queried name
  (§3.3.2). The *conclusion* still holds for this cache, and for a sharper reason
  than the one given: we may only synthesize where we hold a proof, and deriving
  the wildcard from the queried name is what keeps a shallower wildcard from being
  applied to a name a deeper existing node governs.

  **Re-checked against #9a's fix, 2026-07-28, and the rule stands** — the comments
  in `nsec_cache.rs` now say so in the correct terms rather than by citing §2.1.1.
  The two sides *do* disagree, as predicted: `rdnsd` synthesizes at the closest
  encloser, `rdnsr` considers only the immediate parent, so the resolver declines
  to synthesize some answers the authoritative server would have given. That is a
  **cache miss and a real query**, not a wrong answer, and it is the only safe
  direction available: deciding the closest encloser needs to know which
  intermediate names *exist*, and a covering NSEC cannot establish that — a name
  sorts before everything beneath it, so `b.example.com.`'s NSEC covers
  `a.b.example.com.` whether or not `b` is there. Widening it needs cached proofs
  about the intermediate names, which is a piece of work nobody has scheduled and
  which buys only cache hits.

The two halves cannot both fire: a cached NXDOMAIN requires the wildcard to have
been *denied*, so it never applies to a name a wildcard governs.

`rdnsr` checks the denial cache only after the negative and answer caches
missed (#134), and skips it entirely for a client with CD set — that client asked us not to filter on its behalf, and
an answer we invented from cached proofs is exactly that. The cache is sized to
zero unless `--dnssec-validate` is on, the same zero-capacity idiom `--no-cache`
uses, so there is no configuration in which unvalidated proofs can enter it.
