## Architecture: NOTIFY

A NOTIFY is not a query, and that is the whole of the difference. The opcode is 4
rather than 0, so a server dispatching on nothing but the question section answers
it as a lookup for the zone's SOA — a plausible reply to a message that asked
nothing. `rdnsd` dispatches on the opcode now: QUERY goes to the zone lookup,
NOTIFY is answered as a NOTIFY, and everything else (UPDATE, STATUS, the obsolete
IQUERY) gets NOTIMP instead of being treated as a lookup.

**Sending** is on zone load — startup, and SIGHUP where signals exist — for every
zone whose serial moved *forward*, compared against what was last announced.
Unchanged is not news; backwards is not either, since a secondary compares serials
and would ignore it. The comparison is RFC 1982 serial arithmetic, so a serial
wrapping past 2^32 still reads as an increment rather than as a rollback that would
silence the zone forever. The message carries the zone's SOA (RFC 1996 §3.7 makes
that optional) because it saves the secondary a question. Retries are bounded and
any rcode ends them: a secondary answering NOTAUTH has still received it. The
targets are exactly what `--also-notify` lists — not the zone's NS set, which BIND
derives and which would mean sending to whatever a zone happens to name.

Messages are built under the zone lock and sent outside it: an unanswered NOTIFY
takes seconds to retry, and holding the map that long would block a reload behind
the network.

**Sending also happens when a zone we replicate moves**, which is what makes a
replication *tree* work rather than just a star. §3.2's "master" is whoever serves
the zone to someone, and a secondary in the middle of a tree is one; without this,
only the moments a primary learns of a change (startup, SIGHUP) produce a NOTIFY,
so everything below the first level waits out a refresh timer. See [the secondary role](secondary.md).

**Receiving** has three answers now that this server can be a secondary — refresh,
REFUSED, or NOTAUTH depending on what the zone is to us. See `notify_reply` and
[the secondary role](secondary.md); the attempt is logged in every case, since a
NOTIFY from an unexpected source is worth seeing (RFC 1996 §3.10 has a secondary
log exactly that).
