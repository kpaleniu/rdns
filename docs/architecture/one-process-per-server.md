## Architecture: one process per server

Both daemons serve UDP *and* TCP from a single process, and both bind before they
announce anything so a port conflict fails at startup instead of after one
transport is already up. Two loops are spawned and whichever fails first takes the
process down — a server quietly answering on one transport and not the other is
worse than one that stopped, because a client's TC=1 retry (RFC 1035 §4.2.1) or a
zone transfer would simply hang.

`rdnsd` reached this late. It ran one process per transport, which was harmless
only while zones were read-only: the moment anything writes state — a fetched zone,
a refresh timestamp — that state needs a single owner, and two servers over the same
zone file racing to write it is not a design to grow into (see [persistence](persistence.md)). The `udp` and `tcp` subcommands are gone rather than kept as no-ops:
a flag that is accepted and means nothing is worse documentation than an error.

Merging also fixed something that was wrong on its own terms: the rate limiter,
request validator, logger and metrics used to be **one set per transport**, so a
client had two query budgets and the metrics each saw half the traffic. They are one
`Server` now, shared by both loops. The response *byte* budget stays UDP-only, since
a TCP query has completed a handshake and there is nobody to reflect at.

**The two transports do not have the same concurrency shape, and the difference
is the work rather than the protocol.** TCP is a task per connection, because a
connection is long-lived, carries many queries and can hold a transfer open for
minutes. UDP on `rdnsd` is a fixed pool of `--udp-workers` tasks that share the
socket and answer **inline**: answering from an in-memory zone has two await
points in it — the zone-map read guard and `send_to` — and takes microseconds, so
a task per datagram was 1,536 bytes of overhead on a job smaller than the
overhead. What limits the pool also bounds it, which is the point: past the
workers, datagrams wait in the socket receive buffer and the kernel drops the
overflow, which for UDP is the correct back-pressure and is counted by the
operating system rather than by us.

`rdnsr`'s UDP loop looks like the old `rdnsd` one on purpose. A recursion is
several round trips to servers on the internet — seconds, nearly all of it
waiting — so a small pool would leave the resolver idle and slow at once. It
keeps the task per datagram and bounds *that* instead, with a
`--max-inflight-udp` permit taken before the packet is copied. The rule the two
share is only where the decision goes: nothing is allocated on behalf of a
datagram before something has decided to keep it.
