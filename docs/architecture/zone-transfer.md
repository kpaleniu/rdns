## Architecture: zone transfer

`transfer::axfr_messages` turns a zone into the sequence of messages a transfer
is; who may ask is `security::TransferAcl`'s business, and the two are separate
on purpose — the shape of the answer has nothing to do with the policy, and the
policy is the part that must be impossible to get wrong by accident.

**The framing is the protocol.** A transfer opens with the zone's SOA and closes
with the same SOA (RFC 5936 §2.2). That is not decoration: without the closing
SOA a client cannot tell a complete transfer from a stream that was cut, so the
apex SOA is emitted exactly twice and skipped in the middle. Messages are packed
to a 16 KiB target using an estimate that ignores name compression — an estimate
that can only be too large is the safe direction, since the real limit is the
64 KiB length prefix. Every message repeats the question and stands on its own as
a well-formed authoritative answer (§2.2.1 permits omitting it after the first;
including it is simpler and equally legal). A serialization failure part-way
through abandons the whole transfer rather than sending a prefix of it.

**The ACL defaults to refusing everyone**, which is the opposite of how the rest
of a nameserver works and is the point: an ordinary query leaks one record, an
AXFR leaks the zone. Rules are addresses or CIDR prefixes; families do not mix, so
a v4-mapped v6 peer cannot reach a v4 rule; a malformed rule stops the server
rather than silently shortening the list. Every attempt is logged either way — a
refused transfer is a probe worth seeing, and an allowed one is a copy of the zone
leaving the building.

**Three refusals, three different rcodes.** Not on the list is REFUSED (a policy
decision). A name that is not a zone apex we serve is NOTAUTH — deliberately not
the enclosing-zone lookup an ordinary query does, or asking for
`www.example.com.` would transfer `example.com.`. A zone with no SOA is SERVFAIL,
because there is nothing to bracket the transfer with. Over UDP it is FORMERR: a
whole zone does not fit a datagram and the protocol has no way to say "there is
more", so the request is malformed rather than merely unwelcome.

The TCP server's `answer` returns a *list* of framed messages for this reason.
One task pushes them into the reply channel in order, so a transfer's messages
never reorder among themselves; another query's reply may land between them,
which is legal — a client demultiplexes on the transaction id.
